I am currently the lead of the JBoss Application Server project. I am also a
member of the JCP, and represent Red Hat on the future Java EE6 specification.
During my tenure at JBoss, I have worked in many areas including the application
server, clustering, web services, AOP, and security. My interests include
concurrency, distributed computing, hardware and programming language design.
