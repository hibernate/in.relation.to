I joined JBoss in February '12. I'm currently working on two projects: CapeDwarf
(JBoss' open-source implementation of the Google AppEngine API) and Weld (the
reference implementation of CDI); occasionally I also contribute to Infinispan.
I actually took my first programming steps when I was 6 years old and have been
a nerd ever since :). For the last 12+ years, I've mostly been programming in
Java.
