I am leading the CDI 1.1 specification, and work on JBoss Developer Framework, a
set of tutorials and examples for all JBoss users. Previously, I've worked on
Infinispan and I led the Seam and Weld projects, and am a founder of the
Arquillian project. I've worked on a number of specifications including JSF 2.0,
AtInject and Java EE 7. I am a regular speaker at JUGs and conferences such as
JavaOne, Devoxx, JAX, JavaBlend, JSFDays, JBoss World, Red Hat Developer Day and
JUDCon.
I am currently employed by Red Hat Inc. working on JBoss open source projects.
Before working for Red Hat, I used and contributed to Seam whilst working at a
UK based staffing agency as IT Development Manager.
