Gavin King leads the Ceylon project at Red Hat. Gavin is the creator of 
[Hibernate](http://hibernate.org), a popular object/relational persistence 
solution for Java, and the [Seam Framework](http://seamframework.org), an 
application framework for enterprise Java. He's contributed to the Java 
Community Process as JBoss and then Red Hat representative for the EJB and 
JPA specifications and as lead of the 
[CDI specification](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299).

Gavin now works full time on Ceylon, polishing the language specification,
developing the compiler frontend, and thinking about the SDK and future of
the platform. He's still a fan of Java, and of other languages, especially 
Smalltalk, Python, and ML.
