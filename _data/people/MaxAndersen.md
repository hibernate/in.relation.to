Max Rydahl Andersen is the tooling architect at JBoss by Red
Hat.

Day-to-day he leads the development behind [JBoss
Tools](http://jboss.org/tools) and [JBoss Developer
Studio](http://devstudio.jboss.com).

In the early days he worked on Hibernate Core even before it became
part of JBoss, and over time he have been involved in alot of projects
at JBoss, mainly focused on the tooling/developer aspects.

He gets to touch upon almost every technology inside JBoss as they
need tooling. It's given him a unique viewpoint of being an actual user
of the technology - feeling both the pains and joys of a user.

Max have been involved in Ceylon from the early days and tried to keep
up with the evolving specifications. Gives feedback and provide input
in directions of the tooling and as such is now trying to make Ceylon
available from Eclipse.
