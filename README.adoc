:awestruct-layout: title-nocol

:toc-placement: preamble

A bit of Git, a bit of Ruby and you will get your local in.relation.to served.

== Prerequisites

* Get http://git-scm.com[Git]
* Get https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] > 1.9

== Installation

=== Ensure Rake is installed

Make sure https://github.com/jimweirich/rake[Rake] is available. It is often installed per default.

[source]
----
> rake --version
----

If you get "_command not found_":

[source]
----
> gem install rake
----

=== Ensure Bundler is installed

Make sure http://bundler.io/[Bundler] (version >= 1.10) is available. It manages your Ruby gems
locally to the project and prevents version conflicts between different Ruby projects.
Quoting from the website:

____
Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact
gems and versions that are needed.
____

[source]
----
> bundle -v
----

If you get "_command not found_" or a version < 1.10:

[source]
----
> gem install bundler
----

=== Get the source

[source]
----
> git clone git@github.com:hibernate/in.relation.to.git
> cd in.relation.to
----

=== Fedora 22 setup

Make sure the user is in the sudo group

How to Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal: http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal

How to install RVM (http://rvm.io/rvm/install)

Install the GPG key:

[source]
----
gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
----

Install a stable Ruby version:

[source]
----
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
git clone in.relation.to
cd in.relation.to
echo "rvm ruby-2.2@global” > .rvmrc
----

Load the .rvmrc file:

[source]
----
cd ../in.relation.to
----

Say yes to .rvmrc execution:

[source]
----
gem install rake
gem install bundler
----

That's the core of the installation on Fedora.
In case of problem, you can try with the following:

[source]
----
sudo yum install -y rubygem-nokogiri
sudo yum install gcc ruby-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel
----

=== Setup awestruct

[source]
----
> rake setup
> rake check
----

=== Serve the site locally

[source]
----
rake preview
----

Point your browser to http://localhost:4242. Per default the site is generated with
the _editor_ profile enabled. In this profile posts per tag and author are not
generated. The main purpose of this mode is to generate a new blog entry.
If you want the full site generated you should use:

[source]
----
rake preview[development]
----

or

[source]
----
rake preview[production]
----

== Preview changes on staging.in.relation.to

Use git to push on the _staging_ branch on GitHub.
You might need to use "git push --force" to overwrite previous experiments;
possibly check when doing so to not interfere with someone else also looking to publish a preview.

Pushing on this branch will trigger a build at http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/staging.in.relation.to/[the CI Server],
if the build is successfull your changes should be visibile on http://staging.in.relation.to.org/[the staging website].

== Publish changes to production

Use git to push on the _production_ branch on GitHub.

In this case, never use "--force" !
If you have a push error, please rebase first, and possibly repeat the staging phase.

Also in this case a build is triggered on http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/in.relation.to/[the CI Server],
and if successfull the content is then visible on http://in.relation.to.org/[the public blog].


== Tips & Tricks

=== Which other tasks exist in the Rake build file?

[source]
----
> rake -T
> rake -D
----

The '-T' version will list the available tasks with short description whereas the '-D'
version gives the long description.

=== I am getting errors when trying to execute *awestruct* directly

You need to use `bundle exec <command>` to make sure you get all required Gems. Check the *Rakefile*
to see how the different awestruct calls are wrapped.

=== Got a problem with bundler or rake complaining about versions 0?

[source]
----
rake clean[all]
----

or if all else fails

[source]
----
rm -fR .bundle/
----

=== If your changes are not visible...

Panic! Then completely regenerate the site via:

[source]
----
> rake clean preview
----
