== Changes in the `@TableGenerator` and `@SequenceGenerator` name scope

From http://in.relation.to/2018/02/07/hibernate-orm-5213-final-release/[5.2.13] the id generator name scope was considered global but realizing this change could cause trouble for some existing projects (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12454[HHH-12454]), starting from 5.2.17 the scope of the id generators names will be considered local by default (which is the pre-5.2.13 behavior) and a new configuration setting `hibernate.jpa.compliance.global_id_generators` can be used to enable the JPA compliant global scoping.
