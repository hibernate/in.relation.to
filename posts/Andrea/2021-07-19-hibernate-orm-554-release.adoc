Happy now to announce a successful release of Hibernate ORM `{released-version}`! It is already available for download from your favourite Maven Central mirror.

== Physical Naming Strategy

A new `CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy` has been introduced (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14728[HHH-14728]), the new strategy is the equivalent of the Spring `SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy`.

The `CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy` replaces all dots with underscores, all camel casing with underscores and generates all table names in lower case.

For example, the `LineItem` entity will be mapped to the `line_item` table.

== IdentifierGenerator

Hibernate can now get `IdentifierGenerator` definitions from `BeanContainer` when not registered (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14688[HHH-14688]).

== Java 18

We are running tests with an early version of JDK 18 and all tests are green.

== Fixes

Some other defects have been fixed, for a full list see the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project=10031+AND+fixVersion={release-id}[Release Notes].
