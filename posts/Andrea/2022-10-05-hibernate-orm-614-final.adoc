Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.1: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes.

=== Improvements

==== Insert from Select

When an insert from select is executed

E.g.

`session.createMutationQuery("insert into TestEntity(id, name) select 1, 'abc' from TestEntity e").executeUpdate();`

if the identifier is assigned, an unnecessary multi-table insert is no longer generated (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15527[HHH-15527]).

==== Second Level Cache Key

Optimised 2nd level cache size for Redis cache (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15500[HHH-15500]).

=== Bugfixes

==== Insert from Select

Setting `hibernate.default_schema` was causing an error when an insert from select was executed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15517[HHH-15517]).

==== Enum and Query Parameters

A problem causing an exception when a query with an enum type parameter is executed has been fixed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15498[HHH-15498]).

E.g.

```
@Entity
class Event {
    ...

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Type type;
}

enum Type {
    INDOOR, OUTDOOR
}


session.createMutationQuery("DELETE FROM Event WHERE (:type IS NULL OR type = :type)");
```


==== Stored Procedure and ParameterMode.REF_CURSOR

It is now possible to register a Stored Procedure parameter of type `ResultSet` and `ParameterMode.REF_CURSOR` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15542[HHH_15542]).
