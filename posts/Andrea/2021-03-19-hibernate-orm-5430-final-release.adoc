Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 5.4: {released-version}.

== Spatial support for CockroachDB

This release introduces a `CockroachDB202SpatialDialect` in the `hibernate-spatial` module, that supports the spatial features available in CockroachDB v20.2 and later.

Just as CockroachDB strives for (https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.2/postgresql-compatibility[PostgreSQL compatibility]),
the spatial data support is based on (https://postgis.net/[PostGIS]).
The dialect provides similar functionality as the spatial dialects based on PostgreSQL.

This release also introduces:

* `PostgisPG10Dialect` in the `hibernate-spatial` module, a PostGIS dialect for PostgreSQL 10 (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14037[HHH-14037]).
* Support orphan-removal for one-to-one inside components (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-4815[HHH-4815])

In addition, the release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes. See below for the complete list
of changes.
