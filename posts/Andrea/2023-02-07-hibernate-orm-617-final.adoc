Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.1: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release includes some important bug fixes.

=== Bugfixes

==== OneToMany and @Where annotation

We have fixed a bug causing an `EntityNotFoundException` to be thrown when `EntityManager#refresh()` is called for a parent entity having a child annotated with `@Where` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15902[HHH-15902])

==== Embeddables

We have fixed few issues related to embeddables:

* a `PropertyAccessException` was thrown when deleting an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16007[HHH-16007])

* an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` was thrown when loading an entity having an Embeddable with more attributes than the parent that was causing  (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15778[HHH-15778])

* an `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown when deleting an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute annotated with `orphanRemoval=true` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15864[HHH-15864])

* a `NullPointException` was thrown when the model contains a nested embeddable with a non-optional association (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15794[HHH-15794])

* a `ClassCastException` was thrown when a not nullable `OneToMany` association references an entity with an embedded id (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15866[HHH-15866] see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15865[HHH-15865])

* an `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown when retrieving by identifier entities extending a `MappedSuperclass` class with an embeddable id (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16070[HHH-16070])

* an `HibernateException` was thrown when querying an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute with cascade delete orphan (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16117[HHH-16117])

==== Bytecode enhancement and dirty checking

We have fixed a bug causing the execution of unnecessary SQL update statements when setting a property to its current value (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16049[HHH-16049])

==== Polymorphic Queries

We have fixed a bug causing an `HibernateException` when a polymorphic query contains a join (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15944[HHH-15944])

==== Batching

We have fixed a couple of bugs affecting batch fetching:

* when refreshing an entity annotated with `@BatchSize` its lazy associations may be swapped with a wrong instance (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15851[HHH-15851])
* collection batch fetching generated more queries than needed when retrieving empty collections (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16043[HHH-16043])
