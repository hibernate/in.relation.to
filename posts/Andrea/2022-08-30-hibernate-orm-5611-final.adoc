== What's new

This release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes.

=== Optimisation

Thanks to Sanne Grinovero and Bernd Meisel an issue causing severe performance drops in large projects has been fixed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15100[HHH-15100]).

==== @NotFound and Hibernate Criteria

We have fixed a bug causing an exception when trying to select the id of an association annotated with `@NotFound` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15425[HHH-15425] and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.6/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#associations-not-found[User guide]).
