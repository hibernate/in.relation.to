Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.1: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes.

=== Optimisation

====  JSON/XML type
String annotated with `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)`/`@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.SQLXML)` are not anymore serialized to JSON/XML but are now interpreted as plain JSON/XML avoiding serialization/deserialization (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15458[HHH-15458]).

==== ColumnReference
Christian Beikov worked on optimizing the `ColumnReference` rendering, reducing string buffering and allocations (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15462[HHH15462])

==== Merge operation
We have optimised the merge operation limiting the properties replacement operations executed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15471[HHH-15471]).
