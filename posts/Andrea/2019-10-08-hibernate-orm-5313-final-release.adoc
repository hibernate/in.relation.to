Today, we released a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 5.3: {released-version}.

== What's new

=== Improvements

This release adds the ability to perform build-time bytecode enhancement as part of a Gradle build via a dedicated EnhanceTask. Previous versions simply leveraged a doLast hook on the standard JavaCompile task. This allows a chain of enhancers to be run or to enhance classes produced by means other than the standard Gradle JavaCompile task.

=== Bugfixes
