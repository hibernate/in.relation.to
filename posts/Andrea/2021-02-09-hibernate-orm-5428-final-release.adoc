Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 5.4: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release introduces:

* Geolatte-geom support for `SpatialPrediates`in Hibernate Spatial (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-13975[HHH-13975])
* a new configuration setting `hibernate.hbm2ddl.default_constraint_mode` to control the foreign key creation during database schema generation (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14253[HHH-14253]).

In addition, the release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes. See below for the complete list
of changes.

But also, there was a severe regression in 5.4.27.Final : https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14424[HHH-14424].

Since the amount of other improvements we had in the 5.4 branch was rather high, we also released a version 5.4.27.SP1 which includes exclusively the fix for this severe regression; this is meant to help people who need the urgent fix but would rather not yet upgrade to 5.4.28.
