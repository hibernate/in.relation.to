We just released the fourth maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 5.4 with significant performance improvements.


== What's new

This release introduces a new feature that allows enhanced entities to be returned in a completely uninitialized state delaying the load of expensive data until it's actually needed.  See http://in.relation.to/2019/07/30/bytecode-proxy[Bytecode enhancement as proxy] for details on this new feature.
