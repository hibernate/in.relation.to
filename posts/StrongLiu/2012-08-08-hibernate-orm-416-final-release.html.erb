</ul>

<ul class="wikiUnorderedList">
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> <a href="https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-7108" target="" class="regularLink">HHH-7108</a> - This issue is fixed by pull request from <a href="https://github.com/Janario" target="" class="regularLink">Janario Oliveira</a>.

<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> <a href="https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-7520" target="" class="regularLink">HHH-7431</a> - Multi-Tenancy is an important feature that first introduced into hibernate since 4.0, and we're continue improving it based on feedback from community. Now the CacheKey's hashcode generation also considers tenant id (if there is any) and the equals method is also checking the tenant id. So it is possible to do some 2L cache optimization for different tenancy.</li>
