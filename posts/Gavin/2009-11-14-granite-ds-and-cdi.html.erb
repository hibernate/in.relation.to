William Drai has blogged about his experience <a href="http://graniteds.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-in-graniteds-210-rc1-early-support.html" target="" class="regularLink">integrating Granite DS and CDI</a>.

Our feeling is that JCDI is a perfect fit for Flex RIAs with an event-driven architecture. JCDI applications look extremely clean and even though JBoss Seam provides a lot more features, they do not necessarily make sense with a RIA front-end.

The mapping to Flex does look very clean to me. I especially like what William has done with mapping CDI events into the client. Very nice, and very faithful to CDI.</p>
