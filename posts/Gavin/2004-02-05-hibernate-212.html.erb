<p class="wikiPara">
I just released <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/Download/DownloadOverview" target="" class="regularLink">2.1.2 </a>. This is a maintenence release, meaning no especially exciting new features (the interesting work is all going on in the 2.2 branch). However there are some small changes that might make a big performance difference in certain specific cases, especially if you are using a second-level cache. I'm hoping that this release brings the 2.1 branch to the same level of maturity that we were able to achieve with 2.0.3.
