<p class="wikiPara">
Seam 1.1.5 takes JSF where it has never been before: you can use Facelets with Seam's new JSF tag libraries to define PDF documents, and even email templates! It's now super-easy to generate reports and send emails from a Seam application. A future version of Seam will even include JSF tags for generating charts in the PDF document - soon you'll be able to use Seam for problems which you previously would have needed a specialized reporting engine for.

<p class="wikiPara">
Until today, Security was the most requested feature in the Seam forums. Seam/Security offers an innovative authorization model based around Unified EL and JBoss Rules. The model was designed to allow elegant solution of complex cases such as row-level security and ACL-based permissioning. Right now, Seam/Security lacks some bells and whistles, but the hard work is done and we can now concentrate on executing our aggressive roadmap of new features.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Seam has now been tested on all the mainstream Java EE application servers, and JBoss is now preparing to offer Seam support on platforms other than JBoss AS (at first, the list of supported platforms will include WebLogic, WebSphere, GlassFish and possibly Tomcat).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
This release was a team effort by Shane Bryzak (Seam/Security, file uploads), Norman Richards (PDF controls), Pete Muir (Email, select list control), Michael Yuan (WebSphere support) and definitely not by Gavin King (vacation, influenza, girlfriend birthday).
