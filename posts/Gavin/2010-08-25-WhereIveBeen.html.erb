<p class="wikiPara">
A few folks have been asking what the hell's happened to me, and I realized that I have not posted anything here for like 6 months. Well, the truth is, apart from recently becoming a father, I've been quite busy with a <i class="wikiEmphasis">really</i> exciting new project. And yeah, my head is full of a hundred interesting things I could blog about, but, unfortunately, the new project is super-duper secret for now, so I'll have to keep a lid on it until we're ready for an alpha release (perhaps another 6 months from now).</p>
