<p class="wikiPara">
Seam 1.0 beta 2 has been released:
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866&amp;package_id=163777" target="" class="regularLink">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866&amp;package_id=163777</a>
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
There are too many changes and new features for me to list them all here, but
I'll talk briefly about the three most interesting things.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The first is the idea of <q>workspace management</q>. You can see this feature in
action by trying out the Seam Issue Tracker demo application that is included
in the Seam distribution. Workspace management is like a Windows taskbar for
web applications: the user can view a list of active workspaces (Seam conversations),
switch between them and manage them, all within a single browser window. The
list of workspaces may be represented as a drop down menu or clickable list.
If you use Seam's powerful new nested conversation model, you can even have
Seam automatically manage a meaningful trail of breadcrumbs.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
You don't have to write any Java code to take advantage of workspace management
in Seam, just include some standard JSF fragments in your JSP or Facelets pages.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
For more information about this stuff, refer to the Seam documentation:
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
<a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/reference/en/html/conversations.html#d0e2374" target="" class="regularLink">http://docs.jboss.com/seam/reference/en/html/conversations.html#d0e2374</a>
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The second new feature is tight integration with jBPM. In Seam, jBPM can
fill two distinctly different roles. 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The first role is traditional business process management (workflow). In this case, 
jBPM and Seam provide management of task lists, task assignment, business process 
execution, and business process state without any need to write any Java code.
You can call Seam components from your jPDL file in exactly the same way that
you call Seam components from a JSF page: by writing a JSF EL expression. 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
For example, the following trivial Seam/jPDL workflow definition might be used
to describe a TODO list.
</p>

<pre class="wikiPreformatted">
&lt;process-definition name="todo"&gt;
  
  &lt;start-state name="start"&gt;
     &lt;transition to="todo"/&gt;
  &lt;/start-state&gt;
  
  &lt;task-node name="todo"&gt;
     &lt;task name="todo" description="#{todoList.description}"&gt;
        &lt;assignment actor-id="#{actor.id}"/&gt;
     &lt;/task&gt;
     &lt;transition to="done"&gt;
        &lt;action expression="#{todoList.sendEmail}"/&gt;
     &lt;/transition&gt;
  &lt;/task-node&gt;
  
  &lt;end-state name="done"/&gt;
  
&lt;/process-definition&gt;
</pre>


<p class="wikiPara">
Check out the Seam DVD Store or Todo List examples to see exactly how this stuff
fits together, or refer to the Seam documentation:
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
<a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/reference/en/html/jbpm.html#d0e2696" target="" class="regularLink">http://docs.jboss.com/seam/reference/en/html/jbpm.html#d0e2696</a>
   
The second application of jBPM in Seam is pageflow definition. A Seam jPDL pageflow
defines the navigation for a particular conversation. Just like a business process
definition, we use JSF EL to define the interaction between the pageflow and the
Seam components. This lets us centralize all information about the flow of the 
user interaction, and how the different components and pages fit together to 
implement the user interaction in one place.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Here is an example pageflow for a number guessing game:
</p>

<pre class="wikiPreformatted">
&lt;pageflow-definition name="numberGuess"&gt;
  
  &lt;start-state name="start"&gt;
     &lt;transition to="displayGuess"/&gt;
  &lt;/start-state&gt;
  
  &lt;page name="displayGuess" view-id="/numberGuess.jsp" redirect="true"&gt;
     &lt;transition name="guess" to="evaluateGuess"&gt;
     	&lt;action expression="#{numberGuess.guess}" /&gt;
     &lt;/transition&gt;
  &lt;/page&gt;
  
  &lt;decision name="evaluateGuess" expression="#{numberGuess.correctGuess}"&gt;
     &lt;transition name="true" to="win"/&gt;
     &lt;transition name="false" to="evaluateRemainingGuesses"/&gt;
  &lt;/decision&gt;
  
  &lt;decision name="evaluateRemainingGuesses" expression="#{numberGuess.lastGuess}"&gt;
     &lt;transition name="true" to="lose"/&gt;
     &lt;transition name="false" to="displayGuess"/&gt;
  &lt;/decision&gt;
  
  &lt;page name="win" view-id="/win.jsp" redirect="true"&gt;
     &lt;end-conversation /&gt;
  &lt;/page&gt;
  
  &lt;page name="lose" view-id="/lose.jsp" redirect="true"&gt;
     &lt;end-conversation /&gt;
  &lt;/page&gt;
  
&lt;/pageflow-definition&gt;
</pre>


<p class="wikiPara">
Notice how easy it is to get an understanding how the pages and Seam components fit 
together to solve the business problem.
</p>

Seam distribution, or to the Seam documentation:

</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The final interesting new feature is the application reverse engineering functionality
provided by the latest release of Hibernate Tools. It takes just minutes to create
a pretty full-featured application with CRUD, Search screens and full association
navigation. This is a great way to get started with Seam.

Over the past few months, Seam has developed a vibrant community and so I've enjoyed
working on this project more than anything since the early days of Hibernate. Thanks
to everyone who has been involved!
