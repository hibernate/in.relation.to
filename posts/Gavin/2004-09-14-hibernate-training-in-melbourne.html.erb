<p class="wikiPara">
September 20-22 in Melbourne will be the first time we deliver our new three-day Hibernate course. The course has been heavily revised and expanded to include previews of the cool new stuff coming in Hibernate3 and an overview of Hibernate internals (/very/ useful if you ever need to debug a Hibernate application). There are still seats available, if you're quick! This will be the last training we run in Australia for a while, since I won't be in the country much, if at all, over the next six months or so. Email training@jboss.com for more information. (We also have an upcoming course in Paris, November 3-5.)
