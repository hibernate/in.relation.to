<p class="wikiPara">
We released Seam today.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
<a href="http://jboss.com/products/seam" target="" class="regularLink">http://jboss.com/products/seam</a>
</p>

I feel like this is something I'm obligated to blog about. Unfortunately,
I've just spent the past two weeks writing docs and webpages and blurbs
and I feel if I sit down now and try to describe what Seam is all about, 
then I'll just be saying the same stuff, yet again, in another slightly 
different way. (And I'm afraid I get more grandiose each time.)
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
So let me just link to this page instead:

</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Hopefully, I'll find the time to get a bit deeper into specific bits of
Seam in future posts.
</p>

Thanks to everyone who made this release possible.
