I don't know why it had to take 1.5 years for them to take

Of course, rather than apologizing for the <q>oversight</q>, Maher
writes yet another silly and this time dishonest blog, 
blaming us for Genuitec's noncompliance. Whatever - I'm sure
some people will believe his version of the story, but 
some people will believe anything :-)

We'll take a look at what has been released today, and 
hopefully this is the end of this sorry episode.

could accomplish that 1.5 years worth of friendly private 
approaches could not.

UPDATE: Ups! Max thinks some stuff is missing from the source
bundle. He's digging a bit deeper. We'll keep you up to date
on how this news evolves ;-)
