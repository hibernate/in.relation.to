</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Today, we're proud to announce the release of Ceylon M1 "Newton". This is the first official release of the Ceylon command line compiler, documentation compiler, language module, and runtime, and a major step down the roadmap toward Ceylon 1.0. ...</p>

<p>In terms of the language itself, M1 has essentially all the features of Java except enumerated types, user-defined annotations, and reflection. It even incorporates a number of improvements over Java ...</p>

<p>The toolset and runtime for Ceylon is based around <tt>.car</tt> module archives and module repositories. The runtime supports a modular, peer-to-peer class loading architecture, with full support for module versioning and multiple repositories.</p>
