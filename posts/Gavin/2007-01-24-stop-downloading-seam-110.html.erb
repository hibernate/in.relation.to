I just noticed that of the 1630 downloads of Seam since 
the release of 1.1.1 on Thursday, only 666 were of Seam 1.1.1. So I must have somehow 
fluffed the release announcement. (PST is a horrible timezone for announcing things.)

So here it is again, people: Seam 1.1.1 has already been released! You can stop
downloading 1.1.0 now. It already had almost 11000 downloads. That's plenty :-)
