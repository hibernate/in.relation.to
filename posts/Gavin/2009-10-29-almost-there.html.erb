<p class="wikiPara">
CDI (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299" target="" class="regularLink">JSR-299</a>) and <a href="http://seamframework.org/Weld" target="" class="regularLink">Weld</a> 1.0 are almost a reality. We've got word from Sun that CDI and the rest of Java EE 6 will be submitted to the JCP on November 9. I've spent the last few days filling out the Javadoc for the CDI API and SPI packages and making some last-minute cleanups to the spec. Meanwhile, Pete and the others are fixing bugs in the RI and TCK. This process has taken more than 3 years, and an incredible amount of pain, but we're now looking at one of the most well-reviewed JCP specifications <i class="wikiEmphasis">ever</i>. </p>
