I'm speaking about Ceylon on Thursday, June 23, at 10am at <a href="http://jaxconf.com/" target="" class="regularLink">JAX in San Jose</a>. My last conference presentation on the subject of Ceylon was well-received at the conference itself, but not when subsequently published online, leaving we with the impression that it wasn't very effective. So I'm taking a <a href="http://entwickler.com/konferenzen/ext_scripts/v2/php/sessions-popup.php?module=jax_us_2011_&amp;id=19413" target="" class="regularLink">different tack</a> this time.</p>
