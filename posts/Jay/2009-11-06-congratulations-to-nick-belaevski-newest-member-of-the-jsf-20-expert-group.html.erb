Anyone who has worked with RichFaces at all is likely familiar with Nick (usually known as <b>nbelaevski</b>), either in the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewforum&amp;f=261" target="" class="regularLink">forums</a>, <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/RF" target="" class="regularLink">Jira</a>, or <a href="http://fisheye.jboss.org/browse/~author=nbelaevski/RichFaces" target="" class="regularLink">SVN</a>.
