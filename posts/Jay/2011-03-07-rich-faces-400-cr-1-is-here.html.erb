We are excited about this release as it looks like the only CR release that will be needed before we release 4.0.0.Final.  We still need your feedback, to help run it through its paces.  As I've said before CR can also stand for <q>Community Required</q> when you are talking about an open source projects.  If you have any problems, or run into any issues with the release please let us know over on the <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/richfaces" target="" class="regularLink">User Forums</a>.
