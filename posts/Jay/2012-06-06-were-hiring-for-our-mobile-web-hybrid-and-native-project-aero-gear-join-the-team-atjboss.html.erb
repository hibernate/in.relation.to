JBoss is looking to expand our mobile team to develop the next generation of mobile enabled technologies around native, hybrid, and web based applications with <a href="http://www.jboss.org/aerogear" target="" class="regularLink">AeroGear</a>!  <i class="wikiEmphasis">These are world wide, remote positions working with the best open source company in the world - Red Hat!</i>

<p class="wikiPara">
This isn't you're father's JavaEE project. We're creating iOS, Android, and advanced JavaScript libraries to access the power of JBoss from nearly any client!  This will cover persistence, security, messaging, and data synchronization all the way to developer tools, and advanced testing techniques.  To learn more about AeroGear and our plans check out our <q><a href="http://www.jboss.org/aerogear/WhatisAeroGear.html" target="" class="regularLink">What is AeroGear</a></q> page.

<p class="wikiPara">
Not only will we be working with JBoss's own projects, we'll also be working with and contributing to other 3rd party, open source projects such as PhoneGap/Cordova, jQuery, and other related efforts.  We win, when the entire ecosystem is healthy and growing!

As a JBoss core developer you will be expected to be a community member/leader in our open source projects, and eventually a voice for AeroGear, and JBoss in general.  The intangibles are just as important as the right skills.  A great attitude, motivation, working effectively in remote groups, and drive are also very desired.
