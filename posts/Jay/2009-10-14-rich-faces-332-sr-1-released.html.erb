Unfortunately a few regression issues slipped through the cracks and were found by our community.  To address these in a timely manor we have been working on, and just released 3.3.2.SR1 (Service Release).  This release can be downloaded from our project's <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/stable.html" target="" class="regularLink">Stable Release page</a> and accessed in maven using the version identifier <i class="wikiEmphasis">3.3.2.SR1</i> as usual.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
There were only 6 jira issues resolved in the release and they can be reviewed here - <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/RF/fixforversion/12314031" target="" class="regularLink">3.3.2.SR1 Jira page</a>.  Most have to do with the ExtendedDataTable, but others deal with Calendars, ModalPanel, and MenuItems.

Although we never like to have regressions slip through - I think that it is testament  to the strength of our community that they were found so quickly and clearly reported.  Thanks to all involved in this!!
