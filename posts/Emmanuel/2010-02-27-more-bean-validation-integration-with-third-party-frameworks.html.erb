<p class="wikiPara">
It was bound to happen, the minute I announced the <a href="/Bloggers/BeanValidationInWicket" target="" class="regularLink">Wicket integration</a>, I've received a few emails describing integrations with other frameworks (like Tapestry).
I've created a wiki page to list all frameworks integrating Bean Validation and a pointer to their documentation. Go ahead and fill it up with any active integration you are aware of. The page is <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/473.html" target="" class="regularLink">here</a>.</p>
