<p class="wikiPara">
I will be giving a talk at the Atlanta JUG next Tuesday (18th).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The talk will go through Hibernate Search: why using it, where to use it, it's internal architecture and how to use it best.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
I will also introduce Hibernate Shards, what it is and what it is not :)
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Hopefully Q&amp;A will have a decent slice of the time cake.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
See you in the Perimeter area :)</p>
