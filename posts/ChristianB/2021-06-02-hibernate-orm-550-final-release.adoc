We are happy to announce the new Hibernate ORM 5.5.0.Final release!

== Getting started with the Jakarta JPA API

As of version 5.5, Hibernate releases artifacts with a "-jakarta" artifact id suffix that implement the Jakarta JPA API.

At the time of writing, the following Jakarta artifacts are released:

* `hibernate-core-jakarta`
* `hibernate-envers-jakarta`
* `hibernate-jpamodelgen-jakarta`
* `hibernate-testing-jakarta`

Since Jakarta JPA 3.0 didn't introduce any new features, the only change needed is to switch the namespace from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.

To get started, you need a project with at least a dependency on `org.hibernate:hibernate-core-jakarta` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

The Jakarta versions also use the Jakarta XML Binding API, so you also need a Jakarta XML Binding implementation:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

If you are using Java 8 and encounter a `NullPointerException` in JAXB related code, ensure you are using the version `3.0.1` of `jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api` which includes a fix for the problem.
Since everyone should be at least on Java 11+ now anyway, you might not run into this issue at all :)

If you don't want to switch to the Jakarta JPA APIs yet, you can of course keep using the usual artifacts `hibernate-core` etc.
At the time of writing, we did not yet decide when we will change the main artifacts (`hibernate-core` etc.) to use the Jakarta JPA APIs,
but be assured that at least for Hibernate ORM 6.0, we will stick to using the JPA APIs. Even if we do the switch,
we are considering to create separate artifacts with a `-jpa` artifact id suffix that implement the JPA 2.2 APIs so you can keep using the latest Hibernate without having to switch to Jakarta JPA APIs.

Let's consider a simple entity for a person:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.io.Serializable;

@Entity(name = "Person")
@Table(name = "PERSON")
public class Person implements Serializable {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = "ID")
    protected Long id;

    @Column(name = "FIRST_NAME")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name = "LAST_NAME")
    private String lastName;
    @Column(name = "BODY_WEIGHT")
    private Float bodyWeight;
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
----

We can easily save and query that entity with the Jakarta JPA 3.0 API just like it was possible with the JPA 2.2 API:

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.*;
import jakarta.persistence.*;

public class JPAUnitTestCase {

    private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    @Before
    public void init() {
        entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory( "templatePU" );
    }

    @After
    public void destroy() {
        entityManagerFactory.close();
    }

    @Test
    public void testJakarta() throws Exception {
        EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
        entityManager.getTransaction().begin();

        Person person = new Person();
        person.setFirstName( "John" );
        person.setLastName( "Smith" );
        entityManager.persist( person );

        Person p = entityManager.createQuery( "select p from Person p", Person.class )
                .getSingleResult();
        Assert.assertNotNull( p );

        entityManager.getTransaction().commit();
        entityManager.close();
    }

}

Please note that the Jakarta artifacts are still considered experimental.

That's it, enjoy the Jakarta goodness!
