Previously, setting up a Hibernate ORM development environment in Eclipse was a pain.  Many of you have complained about circular dependencies, generated sources not added to the classpath, etc.  We recently cleaned up the 'gradle eclipse' task in HHH-7617 (1).  If you're interested in getting started with Hibernate contributions, here's the easiest way to do it.  Note that this requires 4.2.1-SNAPSHOT, 4.3.0-SNAPSHOT, or later:

<ol class="wikiOrderedList">
<li class="wikiOrderedListItem"> I wouldn't recommend installing the <q>Gradle Integration for Eclipse</q> plugin.  Personally, I've found it to be really buggy and not worth the effort.</li>
<li class="wikiOrderedListItem"> In your hibernate-orm Git checkout, run the following on the command line: <q>./gradlew clean eclipse --refresh-dependencies</q>.  The <q>eclipse</q> task will create the Eclipse project, including generating sources.  The <q>--refresh-dependencies</q> tells Gradle to re-generate the dependency cache -- it isn't always necessary, but I include it for reference.</li>
<li class="wikiOrderedListItem"> In Eclipse, go to Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Building.  Set <q>Circular dependencies</q> to <q>Warning</q>, rather than <q>Error</q>.</li>
</ol>
