<p class="wikiPara">
While <a href="http://www.jboss.org/files/events/javaone2008.htm" target="" class="regularLink">everyone else</a> is <a href="http://www.info.redhat.com/forms/20080500JavaOneSpeakEasy" target="" class="regularLink">having fun</a> at JavaOne we uploaded the candidate release of JBoss Tools 2.1.0 at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866&amp;package_id=242269&amp;release_id=596795" target="" class="regularLink">sourceforge</a> and via the <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/" target="" class="regularLink">development update site</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
This release is mainly 100+ <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;pid=10020&amp;fixfor=12311758" target="" class="regularLink">bugfixes/enhancements</a> based on QA and feedback from the  <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/JBossTools210BetaReleased" target="" class="regularLink">last release</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
A few new features did make it into 2.1.x and you can see those at <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/tools/whatsnew/" target="" class="regularLink">new and noteworthy</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
To upgrade safely to this release please read the following.
</p>

<h1 class="wikiHeadline1" id="H-ExistingSeamProjects"><a href="/2008/05/07/jboss-tools-210-cr-1-released#H-ExistingSeamProjects">Existing Seam projects</a></h1>

<p class="wikiPara">
Existing Seam projects will work fine in this new release, except EAR projects with an application.xml should be updated to have something like the following modules:
</p>

<pre class="wikiPreformatted">
&lt;module&gt;
 &lt;web&gt;
  &lt;web-uri&gt;myprj.war&lt;/web-uri&gt;
  &lt;context-root&gt;/myprj&lt;/context-root&gt;
 &lt;/web&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;

&lt;module&gt;
 &lt;ejb&gt;myprj-ejb.jar&lt;/ejb&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;

&lt;module&gt;
 &lt;ejb&gt;jboss-seam.jar&lt;/ejb&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;</pre>


<p class="wikiPara">
..and nothing else. The &lt;java&gt; elements we generated previously are unnecessary and breaks WTP 2.0.2. The details about why that is are in the following.
</p>

<h1 class="wikiHeadline1" id="H-LessRigidWTP202"><a href="/2008/05/07/jboss-tools-210-cr-1-released#H-LessRigidWTP202">Less rigid WTP 2.0.2</a></h1>

<p class="wikiPara">
We are now targeting WTP 2.0.2+Patches to get some of its important bugfixes. 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Unfortunately WTP 2.0.2 introduced a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=222531" target="" class="regularLink">bad regression bug</a> concerning deployment and <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=230256" target="" class="regularLink">another bug</a> which makes WTP 2.0.2 very rigid about deploying jar's listed in application.xml via &lt;java&gt; or &lt;ejb&gt; tags unless they have xml descriptors (which is not required in JEE 5).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
This affects Seam 1.2 projects and any other projects using binary jars with EJB's in them and projects that uses &lt;java&gt; or &lt;ejb&gt; in application.xml for jars without descriptors which is the case for projects created with previous version of JBoss Tools 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
To get around these various bugs/<q>features</q> of WTP 2.0.2 we had to do two things:
</p>

<ol class="wikiOrderedList">
<li class="wikiOrderedListItem"> application.xml in new Seam projects no longer lists jar's in &lt;java&gt; elements to work with WTP 2.0.2. Besides being more correct and standard compliant it also makes the application.xml much smaller so in overall this is a Good thing. Unfortunately existing JBoss Seam projects that uses &lt;java&gt; in application.xml can run into files not being deployed thus we added a EAR validator that will put warnings/errors on offending elements we know can cause problems and with instructions on how to fix it. </li>
<li class="wikiOrderedListItem"> We provide a <a href="http://repository.jboss.org/eclipse/webtools/patches/wtp-P-P20080506003122-20080506003122.zip" target="" class="regularLink">cumulative feature patch</a> to WTP 2.0.2 which removes the <q>rigidness</q> in WTP with respect to JEE jars without descriptors. It is a hack, but it at least allows JEE 5 compliant jars to work instead of causing a exception stacktraces and random behavior in Eclipse.</li>
</ol>

<p class="wikiPara">
We had hoped this rigidness could be removed in an update to WTP 2.x, but that does not seem to happen within a decent time frame so we decided to release the patch on our own. Note: WTP 2.0.2+WTP provided patches will work for most users, but we do recommend running with our patch to avoid publishing issues.
</p>


<h1 class="wikiHeadline1" id="H-Feedback"><a href="/2008/05/07/jboss-tools-210-cr-1-released#H-Feedback">Feedback</a></h1>

<p class="wikiPara">
We plan on going GA within the next few weeks so we encourage you to provide feedback on our <a href="http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=main&amp;c=20" target="" class="regularLink">forum</a> and <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBIDE" target="" class="regularLink">jira</a> in case you find something bad or good ;). 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
p.s. This version of JBoss Tools (sans the experimental parts) will be available in a JBoss Developer Studio 1.1.0.CR1 for JBDS customers soon.
