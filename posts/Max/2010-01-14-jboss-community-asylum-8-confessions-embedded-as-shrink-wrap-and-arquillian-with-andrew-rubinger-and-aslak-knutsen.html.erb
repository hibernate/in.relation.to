<a href="http://jbosscommunityasylum.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=570171" target="" class="regularLink">Episode 8</a> of <a href="http://asylum.jboss.org" target="" class="regularLink">JBoss Asylum</a> is now available.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
In this late night episode Emmanuel has a confession concerning clustered Lucene indexes
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The news are a compacted version of the massive number of releases JBoss.org did, at least known to us, in December and January
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
And finally we have Andrew and Aslak dropping in to talk about Embedded AS, ShrinkWrap and Arquillian - all ongoing prototype work to speed up and improve our unit and integration testing with EE application containers.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Both Max and Aslak had issues with their connection during this interview, so the audio quality is not perfect in places but we hope you will enjoy it anyway.
