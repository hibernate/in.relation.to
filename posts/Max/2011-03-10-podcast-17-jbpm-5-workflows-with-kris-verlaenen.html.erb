<a href="http://asylum.libsyn.com/podcast-17-j-bpm-5-workflows-with-dr-kris-v-" target="" class="regularLink">This episode</a> had some bad luck with respect to the audio recording and took a while to get edited down to listenable quality.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The news are therefore a bit out of date but the interview with Kris Verlaenen about jBPM 5 is all filled with great and interesting content.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The interview part has good audio and you can skip to the 22m33s mark to hear about jBPM 5.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We are again sorry that Emmanuel Bernard messed up the recording, but we will back soon with a new interviewee and with better sound ;)
