<p class="wikiPara">
A crazy experiment called JBoss Community Asylum is now live via <a href="http://asylum.libsyn.com" target="" class="regularLink">asylum.libsyn.com</a> and iTunes.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The idea is to get a podcast focused on the JBoss Community and its projects: news, interviews etc.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The podcast are done by Emmanuel Bernard, Michael Neale and Me.
