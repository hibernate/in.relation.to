If you haven't yet signed up for <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/register.html" target="" class="regularLink">JUDCon</a> now is time to do it. Especially since Emmanuel Bernard and I will be doing a live recording at
the event with Mark Little, The Technical Head Honcho of JBoss honcho as our special guest.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
If you got questions you would like him to answer, let us know in the comments and we'll do what we can to get
him to answer them.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Another option is that you get a ticket for <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/register.html" target="" class="regularLink">JUDCon</a> and shout it to us during the recording.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Besides the opportunity to heckle us there is a <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/agenda.html" target="" class="regularLink">lot of great presentations</a> and hacking planned for two days by both JBoss employees and external contributors.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
See you there!
