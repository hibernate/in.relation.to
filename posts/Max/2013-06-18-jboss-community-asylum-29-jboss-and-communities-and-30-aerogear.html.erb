During Red Hat Summit we got to record two episodes for the Asylum.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
First a live one at the end of JUDCon where we had Mark Little, Pete Muir and James Strachan discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages in the opensource communities JBoss is involved in.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Warning: contains tongue-in-cheek and pieces of British humor :)
