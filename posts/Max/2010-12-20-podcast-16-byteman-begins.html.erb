<p class="wikiPara">
This last episode of 2010 we are giving you short news and a very interesting interview with Andrew Dinn about his dark project called <q>Byteman</q>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Byteman is a tool meant for automation of tests for multi-threaded and multi-JVM Java applications using a technique called fault injection, but as the interview progresses you hear it can be used for so much more.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
