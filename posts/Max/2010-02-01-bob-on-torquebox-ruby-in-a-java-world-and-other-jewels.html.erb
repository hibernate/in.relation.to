<p class="wikiPara">
While I was trapped in the snowy mountains, Emmanuel and Michael recorded this podcast which has short news and a talk with Bob McWirther
about his work regarding <a href="http://torquebox.org" target="" class="regularLink">TorqueBox</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
They talk about what TorqueBox brings to the table for both Java and Ruby developers and how TorqueBox via the JBoss AS 5 micro-container architecture
enables Ruby to run inside AS 5 and optionally utilize the Java environment for its added functionality and especially clustering facilities.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Bob also talks about why he started The CodeHaus, help gave birth to Groovy and how he got involved into JBoss via his Drools and OSS community work.
