I had the chance to get to sit down with Jason Greene, Emanuel Muckenhuber and their manager Bruno Georges while they were having an JBoss Application Server team meeting in our Neuchatel offices.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We talked about how things changed since our last podcast about AS 7.0 (<a href="http://asylum.libsyn.com/podcast-14-j-boss-application-server-7-is-looking-shockingly-good" target="" class="regularLink">Episode 15</a>) and from that got to cover what is new and great in AS 7.1 and what the new JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 Beta have to offer.
