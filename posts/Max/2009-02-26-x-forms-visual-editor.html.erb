He introduced his attempt on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewtopic&amp;t=151107" target="" class="regularLink">our forums yesterday</a>, and in the evening he was fully running and did <a href="http://planetjbpm.wordpress.com/2009/02/25/xforms-editor-with-jboss-vpe-and-some-jbpm" target="" class="regularLink">a blog</a> showing of the features including screenshots.

Since Ronald were so much on fire I instantly offered him to host the sourcecode for him at <a href="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/workspace/kukeltje/xforms/plugins/" target="" class="regularLink">JBoss tools SVN </a>.
