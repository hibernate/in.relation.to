Weld 2.0.0.Alpha2 has just been released. Weld 2 is an implementation of JSR-346 (CDI 1.1). The highlights of the new version are:
</p>

<ul class="wikiUnorderedList">
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Significant improvement of memory usage. Our benchmarks show that the memory footprint of Weld 2 has been reduced by 50 - 80% compared to Weld 1. This has been achieved mostly by rewriting the metadata layer and separating metadata needed for Weld bootstrap from metadata used at runtime.</li>
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Concurrent bean deployer and bean validator. These two components speed up Weld bootstrap by leveraging capabilities of multi-core CPUs. The bootstrap time improvement is most significant in large deployments. We plan on reducing bootstrap time even more in future releases.</li>
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Stuart removed the Javassist dependency entirely and switched to <a href="https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-classfilewriter" target="" class="regularLink">jboss-classfilewriter</a>
</li>
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Around 30 bug fixes, mostly picked from the 1.x branches (most of the credit here goes to Stuart, Ales and Marko)</li>
</ul>

<p class="wikiPara">
Furthermore, a new version of the CDI 1.1 TCK has been released. The TCK currently provides a solid coverage (90.60%) of the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr346/index.html" target="" class="regularLink">JSR-346 Early Draft</a>
