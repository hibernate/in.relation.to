We just published a bugfix release for Hibernate Search:
5.10.7.Final.
This release mainly upgrades Hibernate Search to the latest compatible Hibernate ORM and WilFly versions,
and introduces compatibility with JDK11+.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== What's new

* Hibernate Search 5.10.7 is compatible with JDK11 and -- if you're into non-LTS JDKs -- JDK13.
* Hibernate Search no longer relies on `javax.xml.bind` APIs.
This is important because these APIs were removed between JDK8 and JDK11.
Hibernate ORM does still depend on these APIs, however:
it introduced new, explicit dependencies to `javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.3.1`
and `org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.3.1`.
* Hibernate Search's WildFly feature packs now target WildFly 17.0.1.
Note that these feature packs are not necessary if you simply use
the version of Hibernate Search bundled with WildFly.

The other changes are mainly related to our build process.
