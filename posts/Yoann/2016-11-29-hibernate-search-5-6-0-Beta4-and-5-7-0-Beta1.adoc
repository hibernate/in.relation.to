Today we are releasing two new versions of Hibernate Search: 5.6.0.Beta4 and 5.7.0.Beta1!

Version 5.6.0.Beta4 brings the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%205.6.0.Beta4[latest bugfixes and previously missing features] for our experimental Elasticsearch integration. This is the version to use with Hibernate ORM versions 5.0.x and 5.1.x.

Version 5.7.0.Beta1 brings the exact same changes as 5.6.0.Beta1, but on top of the compatibility with Hibernate ORM version 5.2.x that was introduced with 5.7.0.Alpha1.

== What's new?

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-402[HSEARCH-402]: A new `async` reader strategy has been added for the Lucene indexing service, bringing performance boosts when you are okay with your queries being run on an out-of-date index (how much out-of-date is configurable).
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2260[HSEARCH-2260]: A new `VALIDATE` index schema management strategy has been added for Elasticsearch, allowing you to automatically check on startup that your Hibernate Search mappings are in line with the Elasticsearch mappings.
 * Issues with `@IndexedEmbedded` in the Elasticsearch integration have be addressed: everything should now work properly, with the notable exception of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2389[`@IndexedEmbedded.indexNullAs`] (not to be confused with `@Field.indexNullAs`).
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2235[HSEARCH-2235]: You can now configure Hibernate Search to send requests to Elasticsearch servers in round-robin, enabling load-balancing. Failover is not supported yet, but https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2469[we'll be working on it].
 * https://hibernate.atlassian. net/browse/HSEARCH-2360[HSEARCH-2360]: Elasticsearch projections now use source filtering, greatly reducing the bandwidth needs when retrieving results.
 * We now test our Elasticsearch integration against version 2.4.2, which fixed https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2414[an issue with date formats] that impacted Hibernate Search. We strongly recommend to update your 2.4.x instances to the lastest available version in the 2.4.x series.
 * ... and much more. The full change log can be found on https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10061&version=25250[our JIRA instance] or on https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/blob/5.6.0.Beta4/changelog.txt[our GitHub repository].

== When will this 5.6.0 be actually released?

We've been caught up in the polishing work with the Elasticsearch integration lately, but we're seeing the end of the tunnel: the list of open tasks is getting https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20HSEARCH%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Reopened%2C%20%22Awaiting%20Test%20Case%22)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%205.6.0.CR1[shorter and shorter]. The first release candidate for Hibernate Search 5.6.0 will land by the end of next week.

So, if you haven't tested 5.6 already, now's the time! Should you find any bug, please report them on https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HSEARCH/issues[our JIRA instance].

== What about Elasticsearch 5 support?

Please be aware that we're not currently supporting Elasticsearch 5.x. The main reason is it brings several backward-incompatible changes that would require quite a bit of work if we still want to support the 2.x series. And we don't want to postpone the Hibernate Search 5.6.0 release any more.

Our plan is to release a 5.6.0 supporting Elasticsearch 2.x, and add Elasticsearch 5 support in Hibernate Search 6.0 or, maybe, in an early 5.8 release. You may refer to https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2434[HSEARCH-2434] to track the status of Elasticsearch 5.0 support.

== When will 5.7.0 be released?

Everything is going smoothly with this version, and very few bugs have been reported. As soon as 5.6.0 will be released, we'll publish the candidate release for 5.7.0.

== How to get these releases

All versions are available on Hibernate Search's http://hibernate.org/search/[web site].

Ideally use a tool to fetch it from Maven central; these are the coordinates:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Beta4</version>
</dependency>
----
====

Or, for Hibernate Search 5.7:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.7.0.Beta1</version>
</dependency>
----
====

To use the experimental Elasticsearch integration you'll also need:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Beta4</version>
</dependency>
----
====

(Change the version to `5.7.0.Beta1` in order to test the Elasticsearch integration within Hibernate Search 5.7) 

Downloads from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/[Sourceforge] are available as well.
