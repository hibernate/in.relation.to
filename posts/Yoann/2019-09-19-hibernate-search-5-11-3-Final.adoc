We just published a maintenance release for Hibernate Search: 5.11.3.Final.
This release mainly upgrades Hibernate Search to the latest compatible Hibernate ORM and WilFly versions,
and fixes a few bugs.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== What's new

* Hibernate Search 5.11.3.Final is compatible with JDK13.
* Hibernate Search's WildFly feature packs now target WildFly 17.0.1.
Note that these feature packs are not necessary if you simply use
the version of Hibernate Search bundled with WildFly.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3647[HSEARCH-3647]:
Fixed a bug causing `@ContainedIn` at least two level deep being ignored when using multi-tenancy.
Thanks to Andrey Ustalakov for reporting this!
