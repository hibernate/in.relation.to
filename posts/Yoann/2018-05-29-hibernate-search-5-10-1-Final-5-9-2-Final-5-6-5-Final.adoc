We just published bugfix releases for the branches we actively maintain:

Version 5.10.1.Final:: The latest and greatest, compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.3 and JPA 2.2.
Version 5.9.2.Final:: Latest version compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.2 (5.2.3.Final and later 5.2.x).
Version 5.6.5.Final:: Latest version compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.0 and 5.1.

== What's new?

Below are some notable changes since the previous releases.

In 5.10.1.Final::
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3173[HSEARCH-3173]:
Hibernate Search now targets Hibernate ORM 5.3.1, which includes several bugfixes.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3163[HSEARCH-3163]:
In some integrations (mostly CDI environments such as WildFly),
bootstrap errors were swallowed by Hibernate Search, which prevented them from appearing in the logs.
This is no longer the case: bootstrap errors will be propagated as they should be.

In 5.9.2.Final::
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3039[HSEARCH-3039]:
We removed the ability to analyze document identifiers from Search a few versions ago,
but some parts of Hibernate Search still performed analysis on document identifiers in some cases,
in particular when querying them and when embedding a document ID using `@IndexedEmbedded`.
This has been fixed: Hibernate Search now consistently skips analysis on document identifiers.

In 5.6.5.Final and 5.9.2.Final::
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3156[HSEARCH-3156]:
`@ContainedIn` will not fail anymore at runtime when targeting a class for which only some subclasses are configured in Search.
