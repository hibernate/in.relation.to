After a relatively quiet candidate release, we just published Hibernate Search version 5.6.0.Final with experimental
Elasticsearch integration, along with 5.7.0.CR1.

Version 5.6.0.Final brings the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%205.6.0.Final[latest bugfixes]
for our experimental Elasticsearch integration. This is the version to use with Hibernate ORM versions 5.0 and 5.1.

Version 5.7.0.CR1 brings the exact same changes as 5.6.0.Final, and now features the compatibility with Hibernate ORM
version 5.2.7 (but not lower 5.2.x, see more on this further down).

== What's new on 5.6 since the candidate release?

Below are the main changes since the candidate release.

For a full list of changes since 5.6.0.CR1, please see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=26400&projectId=10061[the release notes].
For a full list of changes since 5.5, please see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20in%20(5.6.0.Alpha1%2C%205.6.0.Alpha2%2C%205.6.0.Alpha3%2C%205.6.0.Beta1%2C%205.6.0.Beta2%2C%205.6.0.Beta3%2C%205.6.0.Beta4%2C%205.6.0.CR1%2C%205.6.0.Final)[this list of tickets on our JIRA instance].

=== Common changes

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2547[HSEARCH-2547]: nesting an `@IndexedEmbedded` with `includePaths`
 within an `@IndexedEmbedded` without an `includePaths` will now work properly.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2535[HSEARCH-2535]: `@Facet` with string encoding will now work properly
 on multi-valued properties (such as `String[]` or `List<String>`).
 
=== Elasticsearch-specific changes

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2501[HSEARCH-2501]: the handling of `@CalendarBridge.resolution` with
 Elasticsearch was aligned on the one with Lucene: they are now consistent.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2531[HSEARCH-2531]: with Elasticsearch, index names can now be
overridden using configuration properties, just like when using Lucene.
   Thanks to Cary Yu for reporting the issue!
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2519[HSEARCH-2519] and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2520[HSEARCH-2520]:
 the Elasticsearch `VALIDATE` and `MERGE` index management strategies now handle analyzer definitions.
This will only affect you if you were using `@AnalyzerDef`-defined analyzers on entities that are indexed in 
Elasticsearch. If you are, please be aware that the `MERGE` strategy may now close/reopen your index automatically during
bootstrap! See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#__anchor_xml_id_elasticsearch_integration_configuration_xreflabel_elasticsearch_integration_configuration_configuration[the reference documentation] for more information about the `MERGE` strategy.

== What's new on 5.7?

The main change in 5.7.0.CR1 since 5.7.0.Beta2 is the upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.2.7. For a full list of changes, see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=27200&projectId=10061[the release notes].

Please note that Hibernate Search 5.7 now requires Hibernate ORM 5.2.7 onwards,
and cannot be used with previous Hibernate ORM versions.

== When will 5.7 be released?

5.7 is beginning its candidate release period, meaning that as far as we are concerned, it is already ready.
We are giving a last chance for the community to report bugs, and unless we are delayed by major bugs,
the actual 5.7.0.Final release should happen in mid-February.

== How to get these releases

All versions are available on Hibernate Search's http://hibernate.org/search/[web site].

Ideally use a tool to fetch it from Maven central; these are the coordinates:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----
====

Or, for Hibernate Search 5.7:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.7.0.CR1</version>
</dependency>
----
====

To use the experimental Elasticsearch integration you'll also need:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----
====

Change the version to `5.7.0.CR1` in order to test the Hibernate ORM 5.2 integration.

Downloads from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/[Sourceforge] are available as well.
