We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta9.

This release mainly brings a simpler scheme for configuration properties,
a new scrolling API, support for projections on multi-valued fields,
and a complete documentation for all currently implemented features.

It also includes an upgrade to Lucene 8.6.0, Elasticsearch 7.8.0 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.19.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

[[simpler-configuration-scheme]]
=== Simpler configuration scheme

Several improvements to how Hibernate Search handles configuration properties
should simplify how your configuration files look like.

In particular:

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3950[HSEARCH-3950]:
The default backend now has a dedicated prefix (`hibernate.search.backend`),
meaning single-backend applications no longer need to use the cumbersome named backend scheme
(`hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.[...] = [...]` + `hibernate.search.default_backend = myBackend`).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3102[HSEARCH-3102]:
The backend type is no longer necessary if there's only one backend technology in the classpath.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3967[HSEARCH-3967]:
Defaults for index-level configuration properties can now be given at the backend level
and no longer require the `index_defaults.` prefix.

For example, this:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.default_backend myBackend
hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.type elasticsearch
hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.hosts es.mycompany.com:9200
hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.index_defaults.indexing.queue_count 4
----

Can now be written more simply, like this:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.hosts es.mycompany.com:9200
hibernate.search.backend.indexing.queue_count 4
----

[[scrolling]]
=== Scrolling API

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3323[HSEARCH-3323],
a new scrolling API is available.

Scrolling guarantees that all returned hits are consistent (no duplicates),
making it ideal to process large result sets as small chunks:

[source,java]
----
try ( SearchScroll<Book> scroll = searchSession.search( Book.class )
        .where( f -> f.matchAll() )
        .scroll( 20 ) ) {
    for ( SearchScrollResult<Book> chunk = scroll.next();
            chunk.hasHits(); chunk = scroll.next() ) {
        for ( Book hit : chunk.hits() ) {
            // ... do something with the hits ...
        }
        entityManager.flush();
        entityManager.clear();
    }
}
----

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#search-dsl-query-fetching-results-scrolling[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

[[projections-multi-valued]]
=== Projections on multi-valued fields

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3391[HSEARCH-3391]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3944[HSEARCH-3944],
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#search-dsl-projection[projections] can now target multi-valued fields.

Just call `.multi()` on your projection, and it will auto-magically turn into a projection returning a `List<T>`,
where `T` is the type of your field:

[source,java]
----
List<List<String>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class )
        .select( f -> f.field( "authors.lastName", String.class ).multi() )
        .where( f -> f.matchAll() )
        .fetchHits( 20 );
----

[[version_upgrades]]
=== Version upgrades

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3965[HSEARCH-3965]:
Upgrade to Lucene 8.6.0
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3956[HSEARCH-3956]:
Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.8
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3957[HSEARCH-3957]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3972[HSEARCH-3972]:
Upgrade to ORM 5.4.19.Final
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3964[HSEARCH-3964]:
Hibernate Search is now routinely tested against JDK8, JDK11, JDK15 and JDK16.

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

[[breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking changes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3899[HSEARCH-3899]:
`query.explain()` now expects to be passed an entity ID instead of a document ID.
In short, if your entity has an ID of type Long, you need to pass a Long (previously you had to pass a String).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3939[HSEARCH-3939]:
The internal format used to store `GeoPoint` fields in the Lucene backend has changed.
Applications relying on the Lucene backend and declaring `GeoPoint` fields should fully reindex their data.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3948[HSEARCH-3948]:
`@IndexedEmbedded.storage`/`ObjectFieldStorage` have been renamed to `@IndexedEmbedded.structure`/`ObjectStructure`.
The older syntax is deprecated and will be removed before the `6.0.0.Final` release.

=== Documentation

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3962[HSEARCH-3962]:
The documentation now includes a section describing
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#architecture-hsearch-components[the high-level architecture of Hibernate Search]
and giving link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#architecture-examples[examples of common application architectures].
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3954[HSEARCH-3954]:
Documentation of Hibernate Search's internals (for contributors)
has moved to https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/internals/html_single/.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3262[HSEARCH-3262]:
The documentation now includes more information and links relative to the compatibility policy,
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-compatibility[especially for the Elasticsearch backend].
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3677[HSEARCH-3677]:
The documentation is now considered complete for all currently implemented features.
We've completed the following sections in particular:
** link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3598[HSEARCH-3598]: link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#search-dsl-predicate[search predicates]
** link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3599[HSEARCH-3599]: link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#search-dsl-sort[search sorts]

** link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3680[HSEARCH-3680]: link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-programmatic-mapping[programmatic mapping]
** link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3709[HSEARCH-3709]: link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-bridge-routingkeybridge[routing key bridges]
** link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3710[HSEARCH-3710]: link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-bridge-bridgedelement-dependencies[declaring dependencies of bridges]
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3953[HSEARCH-3953]:
The part of the documentation suggesting
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout[how to implement zero-downtime reindexing]
with manual calls to the Elasticsearch REST API
now mentions it's only possible if the schema did not change (for now).

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3636[HSEARCH-3636]:
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-lucene-configuration-directory[Lucene directories]
can now be defined on a per-index basis,
making it easier to put indexes on completely separate filesystems.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3311[HSEARCH-3311]:
Analyzer discriminators from Hibernate Search 5 are no longer available,
but a different solution to the same problem is now documented:
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-alternatives[the alternative binder].
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3929[HSEARCH-3929]:
Hibernate Search is now built with JDK11.
Binaries are still compatible with JDK8, and there are no plans to remove that compatibility at the moment.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3307[HSEARCH-3307]:
When targeting multiple indexes in a single search query,
detection of field compatibility is now smarter and will no longer yield false negatives.

Distance sorts will no longer throw a `ClassCastException` when targeting multiple indexes in a single search query.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3266[HSEARCH-3266]:
Using configuration properties from Hibernate Search 5
will now lead to a bootstrap failure,
to avoid situations where part of the configuration was incorrectly migrated.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3936[HSEARCH-3936]:
Projectable fields in with the Elasticsearch backend are no longer marked as `stored = true` in the generated mapping.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3938[HSEARCH-3938]:
Hibernate Search 6 will now correctly boot and shut down when using an `EnvironmentSynchronizer`
(typically in JavaEE application servers).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3937[HSEARCH-3937]:
Error messages on boot/shutdown are now correctly displayed when using an `EnvironmentSynchronizer`
(typically in JavaEE application servers).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3506[HSEARCH-3506]:
`.boost(float)` can now be used on the `matchAll`, `matchId`, `bool` and `nested` predicates.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3960[HSEARCH-3960]:
Failures of Elasticsearch schema validation
now more clearly mention they are about validation of an existing schema
in an existing index of an existing Elasticsearch cluster.
