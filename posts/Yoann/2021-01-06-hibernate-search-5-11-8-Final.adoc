We just published a bugfix release for Hibernate Search: 5.11.8.Final.

== What's new

This version mainly brings one bugfix:
it ensures resources are correctly cleaned up when Hibernate Search
fails to establish a connection to Elasticsearch on startup.
Not doing so could cause the application to hang in some cases.
Thanks to Valentin Aitken for his contribution.
