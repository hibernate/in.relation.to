We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha9,
a new release of the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly
introduces correct handling of session flushing and clearing,
restores support for static sharding
and upgrades to Elasticsearch 7.3, Lucene 8.2 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.4.Final.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Correct handling of session flushing and clearing

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3360[HSEARCH-3360],
multiple long-standing problems (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1270[HSEARCH-1270],
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1350[HSEARCH-1350], ...)
related to clearing the Hibernate ORM session have been solved.

It is now possible to transparently implement batch processing with a periodic `flush`/`clear`:

* calls to Hibernate Search APIs such as `fullTextSession.flushToIndexes()` are no longer necessary;
* entities removed from the session in the `clear` will no longer lead to a `LazyInitializationException`;
* every document created in a transaction containing a loop with a periodic `flush`/`clear`
will correctly be indexed on transaction commit (and not in the middle of the transaction).

Note that Hibernate Search still needs to store the documents in memory
until they are indexed on transaction commit,
which may be more than what your JVM heap can handle,
depending on the number and complexity of your documents.
Several solutions to this problems are included in
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-explicit-writeplan-process-execute[the section of the documentation about explicit indexing].

=== Static sharding

Support for static sharding has been restored as of
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3314[HSEARCH-3314].
It is now possible to leverage routing keys with Elasticsearch,
and to split a Lucene index into several (statically defined) shards.

See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#concepts-sharding-routing[section of the documentation about sharding]
for more information.

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3642[HSEARCH-3642],
the `DslConverter` and `ProjectionConverter` enums used in the search DSL
have been replaced with a single enum, `ValueConvert`.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3660[HSEARCH-3660]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.3.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3646[HSEARCH-3646]: Upgrade to Lucene 8.2.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3648[HSEARCH-3648]: Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.4

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 now requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.

This is caused by a change (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3447[HSEARCH-3447])
that was necessary to avoid the deprecated native criteria APIs that may be removed in ORM 6 .
