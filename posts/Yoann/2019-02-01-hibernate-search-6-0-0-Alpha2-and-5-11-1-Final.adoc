== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== Hibernate Search 6 at FOSDEM

If you happen to be at FOSDEM in Brussels this weekend, you may be interested in
https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/hibernate_search_6/[my talk about Hibernate Search 6] in the Search devroom.

The presentation will be short (about 20 minutes + questions)
and mainly aimed at Hibernate Search newcomers,
but we can always have a talk afterwards!

== What's new

=== 5.11.1.Final

Hibernate Search *5.11.1.Final* mainly includes an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.1.Final
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3470[HSEARCH-3470]),
which fixes a few major bugs.

For a full list of changes since the previous releases,
please see the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project=10061+AND+fixVersion=31747[release notes].

=== 6.0.0.Alpha2

Here are some notable changes in Hibernate Search *6.0.0.Alpha2*:

* Features ported from Search 5:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3052[HSEARCH-3052]:
Elasticsearch index lifecycle settings, including strategies (`create`, `drop-and-create`, `validate`, ...)
were ported from Search 5.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3268[HSEARCH-3268]:
The mass indexer was ported from Search 5.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3086[HSEARCH-3086]:
We added the remaining projections that were missing compared to Search 5:
explanation (gives an explanation of scoring, for debugging purposes),
document (projects on the whole document in Lucene), source (projects on the whole document in Elasticsearch).
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3351[HSEARCH-3351]:
`FullTextQuery#getResultSize()` was ported from Search 5.

* Improvements implying API changes:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3291[HSEARCH-3291]:
The field definition API, used in bridges, was split in two: type definition and field definition.
This makes the API cleaner in `ValueBridge`,
and lays the groundwork for adding support for dynamic fields one day.
This does make the API more verbose,
but we intend to mitigate the issue in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3444[HSEARCH-3444].
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3438[HSEARCH-3438]:
Type names and annotation names related to bridges and container extractors in the mapping
should now be shorter and cleaner:
*** `@GenericField(extractors = @ContainerValueExtractorBeanReference(type = Foo.class))` becomes
`@GenericField(extractors = @ContainerExtractorRef(type = Foo.class))`
*** `@GenericField(valueBridge = @ValueBridgeBeanReference(type = Foo.class))` becomes
`@GenericField(valueBridge = @ValueBridgeRef(type = Foo.class))`
*** ... and similarly for other types and annotations.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3374[HSEARCH-3374]:
We switched back to the Search 5 syntax for including/excluding bounds in range predicates.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3416[HSEARCH-3416]:
Identifier predicates now correctly expect arguments of the type of the `@Id`/`@DocumentId` property,
instead of always expecting strings.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3421[HSEARCH-3421]:
Identifier predicates now work correctly when multi-tenancy is enabled.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3101[HSEARCH-3101]:
The backend type in the settings no longer needs to be the fully-qualified name of an internal class:
you can now simply use the strings "lucene" and "elasticsearch".
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3450[HSEARCH-3450]:
Several configuration properties, mainly in the Lucene backend, have been renamed for consistency.
See the getting started guide for the new property names.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3451[HSEARCH-3451]:
Index defaults in configuration properties are now prefixed with
`hibernate.search.backends.<name of the backend>.index_defaults.`,
instead of `hibernate.search.indexes.default.index_defaults.`.
This effectively means index defaults are defined on a per-backend basis,
and not globally, allowing to use multiple backend types more easily.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3464[HSEARCH-3464]:
The `*Settings` classes,
holding property names for use when programmatically configuring Hibernate Search,
have been renamed for consistency.

* Other improvements and bug fixes:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3454[HSEARCH-3454]:
Upgrade to Lucene 7.6.0
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3472[HSEARCH-3472]:
Upgrade to Elasticsearch 6.6.0
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3470[HSEARCH-3470]:
Upgrade Hibernate ORM to 5.4.1.Final
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3174[HSEARCH-3174]:
For settings passed through programmatic APIs (for example the `java.util.Map` passed to the JPA startup methods),
Hibernate Search now also accepts values of the exact property type (integer, enum, ...)
instead of only accepting Strings.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3429[HSEARCH-3429]:
The projection DSL now allows a lambda-based syntax consistent with the other DSLs.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3053[HSEARCH-3053]:
The full work orchestration mechanics of the Elasticsearch backend were ported from Search 5:
performance is back to a production-grade level.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3453[HSEARCH-3453]:
Hibernate Search no longer executes blocking ORM-related operations in the Elasticsearch HTTP request pool,
which could slow down the Elasticsearch backend dramatically.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3170[HSEARCH-3170]:
CDI/Spring beans are now released as soon as they are no longer needed,
instead of being released on shutdown.
This should bring some improvement for beans that are only needed during bootstrap,
such as bridge builders or configurers.
