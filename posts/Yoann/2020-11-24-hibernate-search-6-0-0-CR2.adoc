We just published a second candidate release for Hibernate Search 6.0: version 6.0.0.CR2.

This release mainly brings a workaround for applications hanging on startup with Spring Boot 2.3+,
type parameters for type bridges and property bridges,
and an alternative, URI-based configuration for target Elasticsearch hosts.

It also includes an upgrade to Lucene 8.7.0, Elasticsearch 7.10.0 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.24.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

If you want to migrate an application based on Hibernate Search 5,
be aware that Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.
We recommend you have a look at
see link:{hsearch-migration-url-prefix}[the migration guide].

== Reporting bugs

While this version has been tested extensively, and we don't anticipate any particular problem,
the goal of this candidate release is to catch as many bugs as possible before the final release.

If you happen to encounter problems, please contact us:

* When you're unsure whether it's a usage issue or a bug,
ask questions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-search[Stack Overflow]
with the `hibernate-search` tag
or on https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-search[our forums] in the "Hibernate Search" category.
* When you're clearly facing a bug,
report it https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH[on JIRA].
* For more communication channels, see https://hibernate.org/community/[here].

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 5

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 6.0.0.CR1

[[spring-hanging]]
=== Workaround for Spring's hang-on-startup bug

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/25111[A bug in Spring]
may cause your application to hang on bootstrap if it relies on custom beans,
unless you add specific configuration.
This affects Spring Boot 2.3.0 and above.

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4096[HSEARCH-4096],
Hibernate Search will only look for Spring beans when it cannot resolve a bean reference to a built-in bean.
This means that an application that does not rely on custom beans will not be affected by Spring's hang-on-startup bug.

Additionally, bean references in configuration properties
can now use a prefix in order to specify how the bean is to be retrieved.
A bean reference such as `constructor:com.mycompany.MyBean`, for example,
will always bypass Spring and use reflection to instantiate the bean,
thereby avoiding Spring's hang-on-startup bug.
The bean won't be able to rely on `@Autowired` or other Spring features, however.

If you really need to use Spring beans in Hibernate Search components,
until the Spring project resolves this deadlock, the best workaround is to set the property
`spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode` to `deferred`
in your `application.properties`/`application.yaml`.

[[bridges-type-param]]
=== Type parameters for `TypeBridge`/`PropertyBridge`

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4088[HSEARCH-4088],
`TypeBridge` is now `TypeBridge<T>` and `PropertyBridge` is now `PropertyBridge<P>`.
The new type parameter represents the expected type of bridged elements.
It allows for easier detection of incorrectly applied bridges.

See the link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-bridge[updated documentation] for more information.

Existing bridges implementing the raw `TypeBridge`/`PropertyBridge` types will continue to work without any change.

[[uris]]
=== Configuring URIs instead of hosts

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4099[HSEARCH-4099],
the target Elasticsearch cluster can alternatively be configured using URIs,
for example:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.uris = https://es1.mycompany.com:9200,https://es2.mycompany.com:9200
----

The host-based configuration can still be used, but not at the same time as URI-based configuration:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.hosts = es1.mycompany.com:9200,es2.mycompany.com:9200
hibernate.search.backend.protocol = https
----

[[version_upgrades]]
=== Version upgrades

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4098[HSEARCH-4098]: Upgrade to Lucene 8.7.0
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4104[HSEARCH-4104]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.10.0
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4111[HSEARCH-4111]: Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.24.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will lead to potentially cryptic runtime exceptions.
====

[[breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking changes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4096[HSEARCH-4096]:
Bean references in configuration properties (e.g. for an analysis configurer) are now parsed.
Attempting to reference a bean whose name contains a colon (e.g. `my.company:analysis:configurer`)
will lead to an exception on bootstrap.
To work around that, prefix the bean name with the bean resolution mode,
for example `bean:my.company:analysis:configurer`.
See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#configuration-bean-reference-parsing[here] for more information.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4100[HSEARCH-4100]:
Queries and requests are now logged at  the `TRACE` level.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4101[HSEARCH-4101]:
The default required status for Elasticsearch indexes is now `yellow`.

=== Documentation

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4067[HSEARCH-4067]:
Configuration examples no longer include confusing comments (such as `(default)`).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4074[HSEARCH-4074]:
It should be clearer which type of bridge to chose, depending on the use case.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4094[HSEARCH-4094]:
The documentation of the JSR-352 integration now clearly mentions that an additional dependency is necessary.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4113[HSEARCH-4113]:
Documented a limitation regarding the serialization of an ORM `Session`.

[[other-changes]]
=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4102[HSEARCH-4102]:
When using Elasticsearch, the link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout-strategy-no-alias[`no-alias` layout strategy]
can now be selected in order to avoid index aliases altogether.
This is mainly useful on legacy applications.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4069[HSEARCH-4069]:
`SearchResult.took()` is now more accurate with the Lucene backend.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4107[HSEARCH-4107]:
With Spring Boot 2.4+, the methods `Search.getFullTextEntityManager(...)`/`Search.getFullTextSession(...)`
of the Search 5 migration helper will no longer throw a `ClassCastException`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4108[HSEARCH-4108]:
The `SearchSession` returned by `Search.session(...)` can now be used from multiple threads
if the `EntityManager`/`Session` is thread-safe.
Typically, that's the case for an `EntityManager`/`Session` injected by CDI or Spring into a transactional bean.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4112[HSEARCH-4112]:
Hibernate Search will no longer fail to index entities when using Spring with JTA enabled.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4116[HSEARCH-4116]:
Empty, blank or null configuration properties will now be ignored when detecting unused properties.

And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases,
