We just published two bugfix releases for Hibernate Search:
5.11.5.Final and 5.10.9.Final.
These releases mainly upgrade Hibernate Search to the latest compatible Hibernate ORM versions
and fix one issue with the JSR-352 integration.

== What's new

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3801[HSEARCH-3801]:
Having Hibernate Search's JSR-352 integration in the classpath no longer prevents from using other JSR-352 jobs.
Thanks to David Steinkopff for this fix.
