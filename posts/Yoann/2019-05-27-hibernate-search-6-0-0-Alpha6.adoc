We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha6,
a new release of the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly restores decent performance for Lucene index reads and writes,
adds support for indexing `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger`,
reduces the verbosity of the search DSL,
and adds support for configuring on-commit synchronization for automatic indexing.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Orchestration of Lucene index accesses

The Lucene backend now https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3118[more efficiently orchestrates index writes and reads],
delegating those to background threads like it used to in Search 5.

Though no benchmarks were attempted yet,
performance should be back to a level comparable to Search 5.

=== Indexing of `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` as scaled numbers

`BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` can now be indexed with Hibernate Search out of the box.

For predicates (match, range, ...) and sorts, these numbers will be scaled down and indexed as a `long`,
keeping only the most significant digits.

Projections are not affected by scaling: projections on a `BigDecimal` or `BigInteger`
will return the original number, not just the most significant digits.

By default, the scale used will be extracted from Hibernate ORM's `@Column.scale` attribute.
You can override that with Hibernate Search's `@ScaledNumberField` annotation and its `decimalScale` attribute.

For more information, see the section of the documentation
about https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-annotations-scalednumberfield[@ScaledNumberField].

=== Search API improvements

The Search API has once again been improved, mainly by reducing its verbosity:

* `.asEntity()` can now be omitted (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3578[HSEARCH-3578]);
* `.toQuery()` can now be omitted (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3572[HSEARCH-3572]);
* extensions can now be used at the very start of the DSL (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3544[HSEARCH-3544]),
and will be transparently applied to all steps: projections, predicates, sorts.

As a result, this:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
SearchResult<Book> result = Search.getSearchSession(em).search(Book.class)
        .asEntity()
        .predicate(f -> f.extension(ElasticsearchExtension.get()).fromJson("{'match_all': {}}"))
        .sort(f -> f.extension(ElasticsearchExtension.get()).fromJson("{'field1': 'asc'}"))
        .toQuery()
        .fetch(20, 0);
----

Can now be written like this:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
SearchResult<Book> result = Search.getSearchSession(em).search(Book.class)
        .extension(ElasticsearchExtension.get())
        .predicate(f -> f.fromJson("{'match_all': {}}"))
        .sort(f -> f.fromJson("{'field1': 'asc'}"))
        .fetch(20, 0);
----

=== Mapping API improvements

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3463[HSEARCH-3463],
the syntax for specifying container extractors in the annotation mapping
is now less error-prone and more future-proof.

In short, this:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
// Default: automatically resolved
@GenericField
private List<Integer> field1;
// Explicit extractors (built-in)
@GenericField(extractors = @ContainerExtractorRef(BuiltinContainerExtractor.MAP_KEY))
private Map<Integer, String> field2;
// No extractor at all
@GenericField(extractors = {}, valueBridge = @ValueBridgeRef(type = MyOptionalIntBridge.class))
private OptionalInt field3;
// Explicit extractors (builtin, multiple)
@GenericField(extractors = {
        @ContainerExtractorRef(BuiltinContainerExtractor.MAP_KEY),
        @ContainerExtractorRef(BuiltinContainerExtractor.COLLECTION),
}))
private Map<List<Integer>, String> field4;
// Explicit extractors (custom)
@GenericField(extractors = @ContainerExtraction({
        @ContainerExtractorRef(type = MyContainerExtractor.class),
        @ContainerExtractorRef(BuiltinContainerExtractor.COLLECTION)
}))
private MyContainer<List<Integer>> field5;
----

Should now be written like this:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
// Default: automatically resolved
@GenericField
private List<Integer> field1;
// Explicit extractors (built-in)
@GenericField(extraction = @ContainerExtraction(BuiltinContainerExtractors.MAP_KEY))
private Map<Integer, String> field2;
// No extractor at all
@GenericField(extraction = @ContainerExtraction(extract = ContainerExtract.NO))
private OptionalInt field3;
// Explicit extractors (builtin, multiple)
@GenericField(extraction = @ContainerExtraction({
        BuiltinContainerExtractors.MAP_KEY,
        BuiltinContainerExtractors.COLLECTION,
}))
private Map<List<Integer>, String> field4;
// Explicit extractors (custom) => Requires the names to be assigned to classes using a mapping configurer
@GenericField(extraction = @ContainerExtraction({
        "myExtractor1",
        BuiltinContainerExtractors.COLLECTION
}))
private MyContainer<List<Integer>> field5;
----

=== Configurable synchronization for automatic indexing

In https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3316[HSEARCH-3316],
we reworked how to configure the behavior of automatic indexing,
in particular how much Hibernate Search should wait for indexing to finish on transaction commits.

You can now set the configuration property `hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.synchronization_strategy`
to one of three values:

* `queued` to simply queue the indexing tasks in memory and not wait at all;
* `committed` (the default) to wait for indexing tasks to be processed and committed to persistent storage
before returning from the database commit;
* `searchable` to do the same as `committed`, and then also wait for changes to be visible in indexes,
so that a search query executed just after the database commit will be consistent with the committed transaction,
without any further delay.

Each synchronization strategy has pros and cons.
Depending on your application, you may opt for `queued` to favor throughput
or `searchable` to ensure the index is always immediately up-to-date after a transaction is committed.
The last one is particularly suitable for automated tests.

Note that configuration goes beyond just this configuration property:
you can override the setting on a per-session basis
(to temporarily set it to `queued` when performing batch operations, for example)
or even define your own, custom strategy.

For more information, head to the section of the documentation
about https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-automatic[automatic indexing].

=== Search hit explanation

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3353[HSEARCH-3353],
Lucene and Elasticsearch queries now once again expose `explain()` methods,
providing a description of the computation that lead to the score of a given document.

Use `.extension(LuceneExtension.get())` or `.extension(ElasticsearchExtension.get())` in the query DSL
to retrieve a `LuceneSearchQuery` or an `ElasticsearchQuery`, which expose these `explain()` methods.

For more information, refer to the javadoc of `LuceneSearchQuery` and `ElasticsearchQuery`.

=== Experimental support for Bytecode-enhanced entities

In https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3581[HSEARCH-3581]
we introduced experimental support for extracting information from lazy properties
of bytecode-enhanced entities.

We are looking for feedback: if you use bytecode enhancement, give it a try and please us know of any problem.

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3573[HSEARCH-3573]:
The `.object()` projection has been renamed to `.entity()`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3577[HSEARCH-3577]:
Longs can no longer be passed to `.fetch()` and `.fetchHits` query methods,
because neither Lucene nor Elasticsearch supports it.
Use integers instead.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3571[HSEARCH-3571]:
The syntax of requests sent to Elasticsearch has been slightly altered to avoid warnings with Elasticsearch 6.7 and above.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3539[HSEARCH-3539]:
Lucene distance projections are now thread safe.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3324[HSEARCH-3324]:
Multi-valued fields must now be declared.
This should only affect you if you use a custom `TypeBridge` or `PropertyBridge`;
otherwise, Hibernate Search will detect multi-valued fields automatically.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3213[HSEARCH-3213]:
@Spatial bridge set at type level are no longer applied regardless of `@IndexedEmbedded.includePaths`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2663[HSEARCH-2663]:
Null handling for multi-valued properties is now consistent with single-valued properties.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1857[HSEARCH-1857]:
An exception will now be thrown on usage of a `SearchSession` whose underlying ORM `Session` is closed.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1645[HSEARCH-1645]:
The `@ProvidedId` annotation has now been officially removed.
