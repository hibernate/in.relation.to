We just published 5.8.1.Final, a maintenance release for the 5.8 branch.
This release brings several Elasticsearch-related bug fixes.


== What's new?

Here are the most notable changes since Hibernate Search 5.8.0.Final:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2883[HSEARCH-2883]:
   Requests to Elasticsearch clusters with URL-based access control
   used to fail because of a trailing slash. This is no longer the case.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2886[HSEARCH-2886]:
   In certain circumstances, Elasticsearch requests containing 3 or 4-byte unicode characters
   could fail. These encoding issues have been resolved.
