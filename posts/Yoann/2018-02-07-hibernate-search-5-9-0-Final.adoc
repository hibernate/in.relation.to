We just published 5.9.0.Final, the first stable release in the 5.9 branch.
This release brings a brand-new JSR-352 integration for mass indexing,
WildFly feature packs, and better integration to modular environments.

== What's new?

If you tried out the Beta/CR, know that this release is virtually identical to 5.9.0.CR1,
with only a few changes to our internal build process and a micro update to the Elasticsearch client.

If you didn't, then there is something new for you!

[[jsr352]]
=== JSR 352 (Batch for Java) mass indexing job

A JSR 352 mass indexing job was added, adding in particular the ability to restart
from a checkpoint when indexing fails.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.9/reference/en-US/html_single/#jsr352-integration[the documentation]
for more information,
and http://in.relation.to/2017/11/28/introducing-hibernate-search-jsr352-mass-indexing-job/[this blog post]
for an introduction to JSR 352 in Hibernate Search.

[[wildfly-feature-packs]]
=== JBoss modules now distributed as feature packs

The Hibernate Search JBoss Modules, for use in WildFly or JBoss EAP,
are now distributed as WildFly feature packs, which makes provisioning
a WildFly server with an upgraded Hibernate Search version easier than ever.
The feature packs can also be consumed using http://wildfly-swarm.io/[WildFly Swarm].

Also, the modules are now distributed as *multiple* feature packs,
which means that components are split in fine grained packages,
allowing you to pick only the parts you will need.
For example, you won't need to add the Elasticsearch clients to your server if you only use Lucene.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.9/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-configuration-deploy-on-wildfly[the documentation]
for more information on the available feature packs and how to consume them.

=== Other changes

Here are the other notable changes since Hibernate Search 5.8.2.Final:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2832[HSEARCH-2832]:
Exception messages when an Elasticsearch work fails are now a bit less
verbose. In particular they don't include the failing request anymore,
because it can often be huge and ends up flooding the logs (especially due to request bulking).
You can still log every Elasticsearch request
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.9/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-logging[as explained in the documentation].
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2909[HSEARCH-2909]:
Annotations in the default package will no longer make the annotation processing fail.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2935[HSEARCH-2935]:
The CPU cost of static initialization of Hibernate Search loggers
has been sensibly reduced, improving startup performance.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1885[HSEARCH-1885]:
Custom bridges with specific dependencies such as Tika bridges
can now be used in a modular environment such as WildFly.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2955[HSEARCH-2955]:
Faceting queries will no longer fail when the index is empty
or only contains documents without any value in the faceting field.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2983[HSEARCH-2983]:
Boost is now consistently taken into account when building numeric or null encoding queries with the DSL.

== How to get this release

All details are available and up to date on https://hibernate.org/search/releases/5.9/#get-it[the dedicated page on hibernate.org].

== Next

We are going to release a beta version of 5.10 in the next few days.
The upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.3 - supporting JPA 2.2 - will be the main change.

As mentioned previously, the 5.10 release could be of interest to CDI or Spring DI users in particular,
since it will bring support for injecting CDI or Spring beans into Hibernate Search,
in particular field bridges.
CDI support is already working on our development branches,
and Spring support will probably come as soon as the Spring team integrates Hibernate ORM 5.3.
