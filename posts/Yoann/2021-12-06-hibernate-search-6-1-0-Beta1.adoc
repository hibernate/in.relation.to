We just published Hibernate Search 6.1.0.Beta1,
a beta release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search.

Among the main changes:
asynchronous, distributed automatic indexing now scales to more or fewer nodes dynamically,
supports multi-tenancy, and pauses during mass indexing;
new Jakarta EE artifacts are available alongside the traditional ones for Java EE,
the Elasticsearch backend accepts JSON to customize the mapping,
and more.

Hibernate Search 6.1.0.Beta1 also includes upgrades to Hibernate ORM 5.6.1.Final and Lucene 8.11, among others.

== What's new

[[async-indexing]]
=== Asynchronous, distributed automatic indexing: improvements

[[async-indexing-dynamic-sharding]]
==== Dynamic scaling through dynamic sharding of the outbox

In the announcement post for Hibernate Search 6.1.0.Alpha1,
we https://in.relation.to/2021/09/10/hibernate-search-6-1-0-Alpha1/#async-indexing[introduced coordination between application nodes]
to implement asynchronous, distributed automatic indexing.

At that time, coordination supported static sharding only: the number of nodes was fixed
and you had to manually assign a shard to each node participating in automatic indexing.

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4140[HSEARCH-4140], static sharding is still available but optional:
by default Hibernate Search will use dynamic sharding,
which means it will dynamically scale up or down,
adapting the number and assignment of shards automatically according to
the application nodes currently connected to the database.

For more information, see link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-outbox-polling-sharding[this section of the documentation],
but the short version is that starting with 6.1.0.Beta1,
the only configuration you need to enable asynchronous, distributed automatic indexing is this
(you will also need to link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-database-polling-schema[add tables to your database schema]):

[source]
----
hibernate.search.coordination.strategy = outbox-polling
----

NOTE: Since 6.1.0.Alpha1, the strategy was renamed from `database-polling` to `outbox-polling`,
and most related configuration properties were renamed.
See <<breaking-changes>>.

Head to link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-outbox-polling[this section of the documentation]
for information on how to configure coordination more finely.

[[async-indexing-multi-tenancy]]
==== Compatible with multi-tenancy

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4316[HSEARCH-4316],
the `outbox-polling` coordination strategy will now work correctly for applications
relying on Hibernate ORM's multi-tenancy,
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-outbox-polling-multi-tenancy[provided they list all expected tenant IDs in their configuration].

[[async-indexing-suspend-while-mass-indexing]]
==== Pausing of automatic indexing while mass indexing

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4358[HSEARCH-4358],
automatic indexing will be suspended while mass indexing is in progress,
and resume after mass indexing finishes.

For information about why this is necessary and how to tune the behavior,
see link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-outbox-polling-mass-indexer[this section of the documentation].

[[elasticsearch-custom-index-mapping]]
=== Custom ES index mapping

Since link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4253[HSEARCH-4253],
you can link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#_custom_index_mapping[provide Hibernate Search with JSON files containing part of the desired mapping of your indexes],
and Hibernate Search will automatically merge this mapping with the one it generated,
so that it gets pushed to Elasticsearch when it creates/updates the indexes.

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.schema_management.mapping_file = custom/index-mapping.json
# To configure a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index name>.schema_management.mapping_file = custom/index-mapping.json
----

This is especially useful to set top-level mapping attributes,
for example https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-source-field.html#disable-source-field[disabling the `_source` field]:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "_source": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
----

[[jakarta]]
=== Jakarta EE

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4240[HSEARCH-4240],
beside the traditional artifacts targeting Java EE (JPA, CDI, ...),
Hibernate Search now provides link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#other-integrations-jakarta[alternative, experimental artifacts that target Jakarta EE 9.1]
(Jakarta Persistence 3, Jakarta CDI 3).

These artifacts have their artifact ID suffixed with "-jakarta",
similarly to the https://in.relation.to/2021/06/02/hibernate-orm-550-final-release/#getting-started-with-the-jakarta-jpa-api[equivalent artifacts for Hibernate ORM]
(which you should use together).

In Hibernate Search 6.1.0.Beta1, this includes the following Jakarta artifacts:

* `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta:6.1.0.Beta1`
* `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling-jakarta:6.1.0.Beta1`
* `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core-jakarta:6.1.0.Beta1`
* `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet-jakarta:6.1.0.Beta1`
* `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-v5migrationhelper-orm-jakarta:6.1.0.Beta1`

Note that in order to switch to Jakarta EE, you will need to switch to these artifacts, but also:

* Use Jakarta EE-specific artifacts for your other Java EE dependencies,
such as https://in.relation.to/2021/06/02/hibernate-orm-550-final-release/#getting-started-with-the-jakarta-jpa-api[Hibernate ORM].
* Convert your code to Jakarta EE APIs. This should be rather straightforward:
simply replace `import javax.persistence.<something>` with `import jakarta.persistence.<something>` everywhere in your code
(same with `javax.enterprise`, `javax.transaction`, etc.).
* Find a new version of your framework or application server that supports Jakarta EE.
This might be hard to come by, as Jakarta EE is still young,
but some application servers already provide at least a preview.

[[java-modules]]
=== Java modules

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3274[HSEARCH-3274],
where possible,
Hibernate Search now provides multi-release JARs with a full https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html[Java module definition]
that includes all the dependencies.

This excludes the Lucene backend in particular, because https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9499[Lucene 8 has split packages].

[[breaking-changes]]
=== Breaking changes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4368[HSEARCH-4368]:
The link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-outbox-polling[`database-polling` coordination strategy]
was renamed to `outbox-polling`.
You should update your Maven dependency from `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-database-polling`
to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling`,
and the value of the configuration property `hibernate.search.coordination.strategy` from `database-polling`
`outbox-polling`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4372[HSEARCH-4372]:
Several configuration properties changed:
** `hibernate.search.coordination.shards.total_count` is now
`hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.shards.total_count`.
** `hibernate.search.coordination.shards.assigned` is now
`hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.shards.assigned`.
** `hibernate.search.coordination.shards.static` is no longer useful: sharding will automatically be considered static
if you set either `hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.shards.total_count`
or `hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.shards.assigned`.
** `hibernate.search.coordination.processors.indexing.enabled` is now
`hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.enabled`.
** `hibernate.search.coordination.processors.indexing.polling_interval` is now
`hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.polling_interval`.
** `hibernate.search.coordination.processors.indexing.batch_size` is now
`hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.batch_size`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4209[HSEARCH-4209], link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4295[HSEARCH-4295],
link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4347[HSEARCH-4347]:
The table holding the outbox events has changed both its name and content,
and a new "agent" table is now necessary.
You will need to drop your current outbox event table
and link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#coordination-database-polling-schema[re-create the necessary tables].

[[other-changes]]
=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4369[HSEARCH-4369]:
The outbox event processor will no longer wait the duration of the polling interval (defaults to 100 ms)
between processing two batches of events.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4194[HSEARCH-4194]:
If processing an outbox event fails, Hibernate Search will now wait for a bit before trying again.
Set configuration property `hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.retry_delay` to control the delay.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4282[HSEARCH-4282]:
The transaction timeout for event processing can now be raised
through configuration property `hibernate.search.coordination.event_processor.transaction_timeout`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4307[HSEARCH-4307]:
Hibernate Search's detection of its own version (for logging on startup) should now work even on native images.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4331[HSEARCH-4331]:
We added a few default identifier bridges.
+
All types that used to be supported for document identifiers in Hibernate Search 5
should now be supported in Hibernate Search 6 as well
(though https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/migration/html_single/#data-format[possibly with a different format]),
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/migration/html_single/#behavior-default-bridge-java-util-class[with the exception of `java.util.Class`].
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4354[HSEARCH-4354]:
Hibernate Search will no longer retrieve and try to interpret Hibernate ORM metadata
for properties that are not involved in indexing.
This should reduce the impact of metadata parsing bugs in the future.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4033[HSEARCH-4033]:
Entities with `@IdClass` can now be mapped
provided they have a unique, immutable property annotated with `@DocumentId`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4273[HSEARCH-4273]:
`MassIndexer#cacheMode` is now honored. The parameter previously had no impact whatsoever.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4363[HSEARCH-4363]:
Fixed a `NullPointerException` that occurred from time to time on shutdown.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4365[HSEARCH-4365]:
When indexing, Hibernate Search will now ignore deleted entities that were erroneously left in the entity graph.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4366[HSEARCH-4366]:
Exceptions thrown while processing entities for indexing will now include context showing
on which part of the entity graph the exception occurred.
