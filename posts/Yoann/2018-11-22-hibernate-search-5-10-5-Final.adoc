== What's new?

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net//browse/HSEARCH-3407[HSEARCH-3407]:
When using the Elasticsearch integration, multi-valued boolean fields used to only take the very first value into account.
This is no longer the case, all values are properly indexed.

The other changes are mainly related to our build process.
