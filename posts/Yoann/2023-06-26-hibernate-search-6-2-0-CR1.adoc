We just published Hibernate Search 6.2.0.CR1,
a candidate release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search.

This release brings in particular a new `excludePaths` filter for `@IndexedEmbedded`,
and  `includePaths`/`includeDepth`/`excludePaths` filters for `@ObjectProjection`.

6.2.0.CR1 also includes compatibility with OpenSearch 2.8,
an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.6.15.Final,
an upgrade of `-orm6` artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2.5.Final,
and other bugfixes and improvements.

[NOTE]

====

=== Dependency upgrades

[[orm-version]]
Hibernate ORM (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4880[HSEARCH-4880]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4875[HSEARCH-4875]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4869[HSEARCH-4869])::
Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 5.6.15.Final for its main artifacts,
and 6.2.5.Final for `-orm6` artifacts.
Hibernate ORM 6.0 and 6.1 are no longer considered compatible.
[[elasticsearch-version]]
Elasticsearch (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4857[HSEARCH-4857])::
The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8
as well as other versions that were already compatible.
[[opensearch-version]]
OpenSearch (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4870[HSEARCH-4870])::
The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 2.8
as well as other versions that were already compatible.
[[others-version]]
Others::
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4871[HSEARCH-4871]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch **client** 8.8.1

[[indexedembedded-excludepaths]]
=== `@IndexedEmbedded(excludePaths = ...)`

With link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-1182[HSEARCH-1182],
the `@IndexedEmbedded` annotation now exposes an `excludePaths` attribute,
allowing the inclusion of all paths with only a few selectively excluded,
as opposed to the previous approach of selectively including paths with `includePaths`.

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapping-indexedembedded-filtering[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information.

[[objectprojection-filters]]
=== `@ObjectProjection(includeDepth = ...)`/`@ObjectProjection(includePaths = ...)`/`@ObjectProjection(excludePaths = ...)`

With link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4725[HSEARCH-4725],
the `@ObjectProjection` annotation now exposes an `includeDepth`/`includePaths`/`excludePaths` attributes,
which allows in particular breaking cycles of nested object projections.

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#search-dsl-projection-object-mapping-filters[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information.

[[other-changes]]
=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4616[HSEARCH-4616]:
For clarity, "automatic indexing" was renamed to something more explicit throughout Hibernate Search and its documentation.
As a result:
** `hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.enabled` is now deprecated in favor of `hibernate.search.indexing.listeners.enabled`
** `hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.synchronization.strategy` is now deprecated in favor of `hibernate.search.indexing.plan.synchronization.strategy`
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4866[HSEARCH-4866]:
`hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.enable_dirty_check` is now deprecated with no alternative to replace it.
In future versions, a dirty check will always be performed when considering whether to trigger reindexing.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4877[HSEARCH-4877]:
(Infinispan) Provided identifier bridges are now applied in the Search DSL and `id` projections.
