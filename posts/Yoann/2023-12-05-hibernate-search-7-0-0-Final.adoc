We are pleased to announce the release of Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Final.

Compared to Hibernate Search 6.2,
this release upgrades its baseline to JDK 11 and Hibernate ORM 6.4,
brings compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11 and OpenSearch 2.10/2.11,
and upgrades to Lucene 9.8.
It also brings new features such as a brand-new Hibernate Search BOM,
experimental compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless,
compatibility with Hibernate ORM's discriminator-based multi-tenancy,
and other bugfixes and improvements.

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 6.2

[[java-version]]
Java::
Hibernate Search is now using JDK 11 as a baseline and can work on JDK 11, 17 or 21.
Compatibility with JDK 8 was dropped.
[[orm-version]]
Hibernate ORM::
Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4 as it fully switched to Jakarta EE.
There are no `-orm6`/`-jakarta` artifacts or Java EE compatibility anymore.
[[lucene-version]]
Lucene::
The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8.
Upgrading requires reindexing, see the migration guide for details.
[[elasticsearch-version]]
Elasticsearch::
The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life:
* 5.x/6.x
* 7.0-7.9
[[opensearch-version]]
OpenSearch::
The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped,
because they already reached their end of life.

[[hibernate-search-bom]]
=== Hibernate Search BOM

Hibernate Search now offers a BOM providing dependency management for all of its published artifacts.
It can be imported as part of your dependency management to keep the versions of Hibernate Search artifacts aligned:

[source, XML, indent=0, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId>
            <version>7.0.0.Final</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Any other dependency management entries -->
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<!-- ... -->
<dependencies>
    <!-- Declare dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm</artifactId>
        <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above -->
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId>
        <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above -->
    </dependency>
    <!-- Any other dependency entries -->
</dependencies>
----

[[aws-opensearch-serverless]]
=== Amazon OpenSearch Serverless experimental compatibility

Hibernate Search now has incubating compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless.

Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has certain limitations compared to a regular OpenSearch cluster
and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-genref.html[may not support all operations] a regular cluster does.
Compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless must be enabled explicitly by setting the backend version property:

[source, properties, indent=0]
----
hibernate.search.backend.version=amazon-opensearch-serverless
----

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-compatibility-amazon-opensearch-serverless[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information, in particular about limitations.

[[orm-discriminator-multi-tenancy]]
=== Compatibility with Hibernate ORM's discriminator-based multi-tenancy

Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities
that take advantage of
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#multitenacy-hibernate-TenantId[discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (`@TenandId`)].

[[renamings]]
=== Maven artifact renamings

Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed:

* Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification:
** `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core` was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core`.
** `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet` was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet`.
* The artifact `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling`
was renamed to `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-outbox-polling`.

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR2

For a list of changes since 7.0.0.CR2 only,
refer to the link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project={hsearch-jira-project-id}+AND+fixVersion={hsearch-jira-version-id}[release notes].

== How to get this release

All details are available and up to date on the
link:https://hibernate.org/search/releases/{hsearch-version-family}/#get-it[dedicated page on hibernate.org].

== Getting started, migrating

For new applications,
refer to the getting started guide:

* link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-getting-started[here for the Hibernate ORM integration]
* link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started[here for the Standalone POJO Mapper]

For existing applications,
assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with `-orm6` artifacts,
upgrading to Hibernate Search {hsearch-version-family} mainly requires
removing the `-orm6` suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies
updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the <<hibernate-search-bom,BOM>>),
and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any.

Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes
is included in the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/{hsearch-version-family}/migration/html_single/[migration guide].
