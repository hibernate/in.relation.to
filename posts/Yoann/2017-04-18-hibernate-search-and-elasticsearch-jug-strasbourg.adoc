Just a quick heads-up to French-speaking developers:
I will be presenting the Elasticsearch integration in Hibernate Search at the Strasbourg Java User Group (ElsassJUG) meetup,
at 7 PM on Wednesday 26th of April.

I will briefly introduce full-text search (why and how it's done),
then present how to use Hibernate Search to keep Lucene indexes in sync with your Hibernate ORM entities,
and I will show you how easy it is to target Elasticsearch instead of local Lucene indexes since Hibernate Search 5.6.0.
