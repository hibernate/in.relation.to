We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta7.

This release mainly improves sorts and aggregations on multi-valued or nested fields,
introduces dynamic index fields through field templates,
restores the index metamodel,
and restores low-level Lucene settings.
It also includes an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.15.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Better sorts and aggregations on multi-valued/nested fields

As of Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta7,
aggregations in the Lucene backend now work correctly on multi-valued fields
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1927[HSEARCH-1927], https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1929[HSEARCH-1929])
and on fields in nested documents (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3892[HSEARCH-3892]).

What's more, both sorts and aggregations now support filtering when the field being sorted/aggregated on
is located in a nested document (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3846[HSEARCH-3846],
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3881[HSEARCH-3881]).
This is particularly useful to sort on a field that is usually multi-valued,
but becomes single-valued after you apply the criteria of your query.
Think of a search on t-shirts, sorting by price, where each t-shirt has multiple sizes with its own price;
when searching for a specific t-shirt size, you'll want to sort on the price of each t-shirt for that size only.
See the reference documentation for details and examples:
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-sort-common-filter[here for sorts]
and
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-aggregation-common-filter[here for aggregations].

Many thanks to Waldemar Kłaczyński for providing the groundwork that made this possible.

=== Dynamic index fields through field templates

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3273[HSEARCH-3273],
it is now possible to add fields to documents even if they weren't declared beforehand,
provided you declared matching _field templates_.

This means you can implement a bridge that will index a schema-less JSON object, for example,
provided the properties of JSON objects are named following specific conventions that you can set yourself
(such as `*_int` for integers, `*_txt` for text, etc.).

You can declare field templates by defining custom bridges;
see https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-bridge-index-field-dsl-dynamic[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information.

=== Index metamodel

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3589[HSEARCH-3589],
Hibernate Search exposes a metamodel for its indexes,
effectively allowing to look up fields of a specific index and their characteristics.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-mapping-inspect[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information.

=== Low-level configuration for the Lucene backends

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3776[HSEARCH-3776],
several low-level configuration options relating to the Lucene `IndexWriter` have been restored.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-io-writer[here for index writer settings]
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-io-merge[here for merge settings].

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3777[HSEARCH-3777],
the `Similarity` used when indexing and searching in the Lucene backend
can be
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-analysis-similarity[configured through the `LuceneAnalysisConfigurer`].

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3907[HSEARCH-3907]: Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.15.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3898[HSEARCH-3898]:
`SearchQuery.explain(String, String)` now expects to be passed the name of a mapped type,
instead of the name of an index.

=== Documentation

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3887[HSEARCH-3887]:
The documentation no longer incorrectly states that routing keys don't trigger filtering.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3879[HSEARCH-3879]:
Configuration options related to thread pools and indexing are now explained more clearly.

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3886[HSEARCH-3886]:
Documents with missing values are now sorted last by default in sorts by field value,
instead of being inserted next to "zero" values.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3896[HSEARCH-3896]:
Calling `.fetch` on the same `SearchQuery` multiple times now works correctly.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3897[HSEARCH-3897]
and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3898[HSEARCH-3898]:
`explain()` now works correctly for indexes with a custom name;
when the query targets multiple types, you should pass the JPA type name
instead of the index name.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3901[HSEARCH-3901]:
The context passed to `PropertyMappingAnnotationProcessor`/`TypeMappingAnnotationProcessor`
now exposes an `annotatedElement()` method to inspect the annotated element (type, name and annotations).
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3911[HSEARCH-3911]:
`LuceneSearchResult` now exposes a `getTopDocs()` method.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3914[HSEARCH-3914]:
`LuceneSearchQuery` now exposes a `getLuceneSort()` method.
