We just published 5.10.0.Beta1, the first beta release for the 5.10 branch.
The main goal of this release is to target Hibernate ORM 5.3,
but it also adds DI framework integration and a TikaBridge improvement: see below!

Hibernate ORM 5.3 has not been officially released yet, and is still just a candidate release,
so this might be a good time to try to upgrade your application to ORM 5.3 + Search 5.10 and report any problems!

== What's new?

Here are some notable changes since Hibernate Search 5.9.0.Final:

* link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2978[HSEARCH-2978]/link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3017[HSEARCH-3017]:
Hibernate Search 5.10 is designed to work with Hibernate ORM 5.3.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2979[HSEARCH-2979]:
Hibernate Search now taps into Hibernate ORM's integration to dependency injection frameworks.
If you use a dependency injection framework integrating with Hibernate ORM 5.3,
and you add field bridges to your dependency injection context,
then Hibernate Search will automatically retrieve and use field bridges from this context.
+
This allows you in particular to inject components from your DI context into your field bridges,
using your DI framework's features (`@java.inject.Inject`, Spring's `@Autowired`, ...).
+
The integration is already known to work in a CDI 2.0 environment such as WildFly 12
(not released yet as of February 23, 2018),
and the Spring team will probably make it work as soon as it adds support for JPA 2.2.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3019[HSEARCH-3019]:
Tika bridges now offer the option to provide your own Tika parser
instead of relying on content auto-detection using the default configuration.
See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.10/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapping-tika-bridge[TikaBridge documentation]
for more information.
