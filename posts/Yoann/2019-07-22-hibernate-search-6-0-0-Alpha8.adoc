We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha8,
a new release of the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly restores configuration options for entity loading and Lucene index storage,
brings simpler and more powerful bridge APIs,
and upgrades to Elasticsearch 7.2 and Lucene 8.1.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Configurable, tested and optimized entity loading

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3349[HSEARCH-3349],
entity loading has been optimized, tested more thoroughly,
and is now configurable.

Head to https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-query-entity-loading-options[this section of the documentation]
for more information about configuration options.

=== Configurable and extensible Lucene storage

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3440[HSEARCH-3440],
Lucene index storage can now be configured more finely,
and if you're an integrator, you can even plug in your own storage technology.

Head to https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-configuration-directory[this section of the documentation]
for more information about configuration options.

=== Simpler and more powerful bridge APIs

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3609[HSEARCH-3609],
the new bridge APIs have been polished to be simpler to use for simple cases,
and safer yet powerful for more complex use cases.

For an early look at these APIs, head over to https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/pull/2034[this pull request].
More in-depth explanations will be added to the documentation in the next few releases.

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3602[HSEARCH-3602],
DSL interface now use the "Step" suffix instead of the "Context" suffix.
This generally should not impact existing client code,
as these interfaces are not meant to be used directly
(you don't need to declare variables with these types).

Some types have also been renamed for consistency,
and these renamings will impact existing code: in particular,
the type of the "context" parameter in `*Configurer` types
has changed.

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3609[HSEARCH-3609]
also brought backward-incompatible changes to the bridge APIs,
which are not yet documented.
