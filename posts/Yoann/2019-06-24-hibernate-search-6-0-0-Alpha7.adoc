We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha7,
a new release of the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly restores missing parameters for index field types,
restores explicit indexing APIs,
and upgrades to Elasticsearch 6.8 and 7.1.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== All Hibernate Search 5 field type parameters are implemented

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3048[HSEARCH-3048] added support
for the `searchable`, `norms` and `termVectors` field type parameters,
bringing Search 6 on par with Search 5.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-annotation-attributes[this section of the documentation]
for a description of all available field type parameters.

=== Explicit index write APIs are back

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3049[HSEARCH-3049] introduced APIs for explicit writes to indexes,
as an alternative or complement to automatic indexing.

The APIs are different from Search 5, but provide similar features.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-explicit[the "Explicit indexing" section]
of the documentation for more information.

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3610[HSEARCH-3610]:
`Search.getSearchSession(Session)` was renamed to `Search.session(Session)`.
The old method is still available, but will be removed soon.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3591[HSEARCH-3591]:
`SearchQueryContext#sort` now expects a `Function` parameter instead of a `Consumer`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3617[HSEARCH-3617]:
The `by(SearchSort)` method was removed from the sort DSL.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3604[HSEARCH-3604]:
The concept of "reference projection" has been renamed to "entity reference projection":
in the search DSL, `asReference()` became `asEntityReference()`
and `reference()` became `entityReference()`.
Search queries returning references to entities now use
the `org.hibernate.search.mapper.orm.common.EntityReference` type instead of `PojoReference`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3605[HSEARCH-3605]:
Some API types related to bridges, container extractors and annotation-based entity mapping
have been moved for the sake of consistency.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3587[HSEARCH-3587]:
`MarkerMapping#builder` was renamed to `MarkerMapping#marker`.

=== Documentation

The documentation continues to grow:

* There is javadoc on all APIs (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3367[HSEARCH-3367]).
* Every available https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-predicate[predicate],
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-sort[sort]
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-projection[projection]
is referenced and has at least one example in the documentation.
* Newly reintroduced features such as the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-explicit[write APIs]
are being documented progressively.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3611[HSEARCH-3611]: Add support for Elasticsearch 6.8
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3592[HSEARCH-3592]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.1
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3595[HSEARCH-3595]: Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.3.Final

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2539[HSEARCH-2539]:
`MassIndexer.start()` now returns a `CompletableFuture` instead of a `Future`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3203[HSEARCH-3203]:
`@DocumentId` now works correctly on properties that are not the entity ID.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3254[HSEARCH-3254]:
When building a field sort, `.onMissingValue().use()` now works properly for string fields with the Lucene backend.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3255[HSEARCH-3255]:
When building a field sort, `.onMissingValue().use()` now works properly for date/time fields with the Elasticsearch backend.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3616[HSEARCH-3616]:
When building a "match id" predicate, the `matchingAny()` now expects a `Collection<?>` instead of `Collection<Object>`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3618[HSEARCH-3618]:
Distance projection will no longer lead to missing hits.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3192[HSEARCH-3192]:
`SearchPredicate`, `SearchSort` and `SearchProjection` can now safely be cached and reused
from one scope instance to another: Hibernate Search will check that they are compatible with the new scope.
