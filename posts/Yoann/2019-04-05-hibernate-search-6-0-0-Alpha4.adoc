We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha4, the fourth release for the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly adds an "exists" predicate,
improves the DSL by allowing to bypass DSL and projection converters or to override analyzers,
restores the Elasticsearch AWS integration,
and upgrades the Lucene backend to Lucene 8.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].
====

== What's new

=== New "exists" predicate

We added support for the "exists" predicate in the Search DSL,
allowing to filter documents according to the presence or absence of a non-`null` value for a given field:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
SearchQuery<MyEntity> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class).asEntity()
    .predicate(f -> f.exists().onField("someField"))
    .toQuery();
----

=== The Elasticsearch AWS integration is back

We restored the AWS integration as part of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3051[HSEARCH-3051].
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-elasticsearch-configuration-aws[the dedicated section in the documentation]
to configure your backend to talk with an AWS-managed Elasticsearch service.

=== Converters can be bypassed in predicates

DSL and projection converters automatically convert values from the type expected by the user to the underlying type exposed by backends.
For example `java.util.Date` properties have a converter between that type and `Instant`.

Just like the `.ignoreFieldBridge` option in Search 5,
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3510[there is now an option] to bypass these converters in Search 6:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
// When the value to match is a java.util.Date
Date dateToMatch = /* ... */;
SearchQuery<MyEntity> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class).asEntity()
    .predicate(f -> f.match().onField("myJavaUtilDate").matching(dateToMatch))
    .toQuery();

// When the value to match is a java.time.Instant
Instant instantToMatch = /* ... */;
SearchQuery<MyEntity> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class).asEntity()
    .predicate(f -> f.match().onField("myJavaUtilDate").matching(instantToMatch, DslConverter.DISABLED))
    .toQuery();
----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
// When we need the projection as a java.util.Date
SearchQuery<Date> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class)
    .asProjection(f -> f.field("myJavaUtilDate", Date.class)
    .predicate(f -> f.matchAll())
    .toQuery();

// When we need the projection as a java.time.Instant
SearchQuery<Instant> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class)
    .asProjection(f -> f.field("myJavaUtilDate", Instant.class, ProjectionConverter.DISABLED)
    .predicate(f -> f.matchAll())
    .toQuery();
----

=== Analyzers can be overridden at query time

Analyzers could already be overridden in Search 5, but only at the `QueryBuilder` level and on a per-field basis,
which could be annoying if you had many fields in your predicates or if you needed two predicates with different overrides.

In Search 6, https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3312[you can now override analyzers on a per-predicate basis]:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
SearchQuery<MyEntity> query = searchSession.search(MyEntity.class).asEntity()
    .predicate(f -> f.match().onField("name_autocomplete").matching(userInput).analyzer("edgengram_query"))
    .toQuery();
----

=== Configuration

Since https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3521[HSEARCH-3521],
the property keys for index-scoped configuration properties are now prefixed with `.backends.<backend name>`.
For example:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.indexes.myIndex.lifecycle.strategy = create
----

See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#configuration[section about configuration in the reference documentation]
for more information.
