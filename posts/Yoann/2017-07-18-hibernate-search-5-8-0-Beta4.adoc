We just published Hibernate Search version 5.8.0.Beta4,
with <<aws-integration,AWS integration>>
as well as bugfixes and improvements over http://in.relation.to/2017/06/13/hibernate-search-5-8-0-Beta3/[5.8.0.Beta3].

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 5.8.x, just as 5.7.x, is only compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.2.3 and later.

If you need to use Hibernate ORM 5.0.x or 5.1.x, use the older Hibernate Search 5.6.x.
====

== 5.8 status

We completed most of the work on new features and improvements for 5.8,
and are now mainly working on performance improvements for the Elasticsearch integration.

As a consequence, you can expect the next version we'll publish to be a candidate release.

Once the CR is out, we will only fix bugs,
and functional improvements will have to wait until the next minor release.

So if you plan on using <<aws-integration,AWS integration>>,
http://in.relation.to/2017/06/13/hibernate-search-5-8-0-Beta3/#normalizers[normalizers],
http://in.relation.to/2017/06/13/hibernate-search-5-8-0-Beta3/#analyzer-providers[analyzer providers],
or http://in.relation.to/2017/06/13/hibernate-search-5-8-0-Beta3/#bean-resolver[SPIs for integration of dependency injection frameworks],
now's the last time to ask for improvements before the actual release!

== What's new in Beta4?

[[aws-integration]]
=== AWS integration

Building on the new SPIs introduced in Beta3,
we added a new module allowing you to very simply wire your Hibernate Search instance
to an AWS-hosted Elasticsearch cluster using Amazon's proprietary IAM authentication mechanism. 

You can find more information about how to use this integration in the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration-configuration-aws[reference documentation].

=== And more!

A summary of other notable changes:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2783[HSEARCH-2783]: the `buffer_size_on_copy` configuration
   property has been deprecated, because we now use Java NIO for file copy and thus don't need explicit buffering anymore.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2785[HSEARCH-2785]: using `.phrase()` and `.keyword()`
   on the `QueryBuilder` for normalized fields no longer fails with Elasticsearch.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2776[HSEARCH-2776] and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2777[HSEARCH-2777]:
   `javax.transaction` dependencies are no longer incorrectly marked as optional in the OSGi manifest.
