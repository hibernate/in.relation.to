We just published a new candidate release for Hibernate Search: 7.0.0.CR2.

This release upgrades to the recently released Hibernate ORM 6.4;
as this upgrade implies dropping compatibility with Hibernate ORM 6.3,
it was deemed a big enough change to warrant a second candidate release.
7.0.0.CR2 also contains a few bugfixes and improvements;
see below for more information.

== What's new

[NOTE]
====
For a summary of all new features and improvements since 6.2,
head to https://hibernate.org/search/releases/7.0/#whats-new[the dedicated page on hibernate.org].
====

=== Dependency upgrades

[[jdk-version]]
JDK 11 (reminder)::
Hibernate Search now requires Java 11 as a baseline and is no longer compatible with Java 8.
[[jakarta-ee-version]]
Switch to Jakarta EE (reminder)::
Hibernate Search completely switched to Jakarta EE and is not compatible with Java EE anymore.
All of `-orm6` and `-jakarta` artifacts from the previous series that provided Hibernate ORM 6 and Jakarta EE compatibility
are now unavailable since this compatibility is now provided by the main artifacts.
[[orm-version]]
Hibernate ORM (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5008[HSEARCH-5008])::
Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.0.Final.
[[lucene-version]]
Lucene (reminder)::
The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8.
[[elasticsearch-version]]
Elasticsearch (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5005[HSEARCH-5005]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5012[HSEARCH-5012])::
The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life:
* 5.x/6.x (compatibility dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Beta1)
* 7.0-7.9 (compatibility dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1)
[[opensearch-version]]
OpenSearch (reminder)::
The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible --
except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped
in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1,
because they already reached their end of life.
[[others-version]]
Others::
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5005[HSEARCH-5005]/link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5012[HSEARCH-5012]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch **client** 8.11.1
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4996[HSEARCH-4996] Upgrade to JBeret 2.1.3.Final

[[other-changes]]
=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4995[HSEARCH-4995]:
Hibernate Search will no longer log exceptions encountered during complex operations (boot, schema validation) at the `ERROR` level, but at the `TRACE` level.
To propagate these exceptions, Hibernate Search will add them as "suppressed" to the exception thrown at the end (of boot/schema validation).
+
This means in particular that explicit uses of `SchemaManager` (e.g. for schema validation)
that encounter exceptions (e.g. inconsistent Elasticsearch index aliases)
will no longer flood the logs,
but will instead result in an exception with all the necessary information,
in its own message (failure report with short description of all failures)
and in its suppressed exception (full stack trace of all relevant exceptions).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4999[HSEARCH-4999]:
Elasticsearch spatial predicates will now use the `geo_shape` query instead of the deprecated `geo_polygon` query.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-5015[HSEARCH-5015]:
`OutboxEvent` is no longer a final class,
avoiding warnings in some situations where Hibernate ORM would try to generate proxy classes for `OutboxEvent`.

And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases,

== How to get this release

All details are available and up to date on the
link:https://hibernate.org/search/releases/{hsearch-version-family}/#get-it[dedicated page on hibernate.org].

== Getting started, migrating

For new applications,
refer to the getting started guide:

* link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-getting-started[here for the Hibernate ORM integration]
* link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started[here for the Standalone POJO Mapper]

For existing applications,
assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with `-orm6` artifacts,
upgrading to Hibernate Search {hsearch-version-family} mainly requires
removing the `-orm6` suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies
updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the <<hibernate-search-bom,BOM>>),
and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any.

Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes
is included in the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/{hsearch-version-family}/migration/html_single/[migration guide].
