With `outbox-polling` coordination and when using DB2,
`OutboxEvent` table used to be created with a `payload` column with the wrong type `blob(255)`,
making it almost unusable. It is no longer the case.

Automatic reindexing will no longer be skipped when changing a property annotated with `@OneToOne(mappedBy = ...) @IndexedEmbedded`
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4703[HSEARCH-4703]:
Fixed missing entries in the Java module descriptor of `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling`
leading to errors when running Hibernate Search in the modulepath.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4735[HSEARCH-4735]:
Hibernate Search 6.1 is now regularly tested for compatibility with Hibernate ORM 6.2

=== 5.11.12.Final
