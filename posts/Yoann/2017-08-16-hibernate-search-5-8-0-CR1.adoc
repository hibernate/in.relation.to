We just published Hibernate Search version 5.8.0.CR1,
with bugfixes and improvements over http://in.relation.to/2017/07/18/hibernate-search-5-8-0-Beta4/[5.8.0.Beta4].

Version 5.8.0.CR1 is the last opportunity for the community to test it and report bugs before the release.

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 5.8.x, just as 5.7.x, is only compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.2.3 and later.

If you need to use Hibernate ORM 5.0.x or 5.1.x, use the older Hibernate Search 5.6.x.

== What's new in CR1?

Here are the most notable changes:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2831[HSEARCH-2831]:
  request signing for Amazon's proprietary IAM authentication mechanism
  https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration-configuration-aws[now requires you to set the `hibernate.search.default.elasticsearch.aws.signing.enabled` property to `true`],
  allowing you to easily disable signing even if the `hibernate-search-elasticsearch-aws` JAR is in your classpath.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2818[HSEARCH-2818] / https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2821[HSEARCH-2821]:
  sending requests to Elasticsearch is now much less memory-consuming.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2764[HSEARCH-2764]:
  we improved the orchestration of index updates before they are sent to the Elasticsearch client:
 ** Index updates originating from a single Hibernate Search node will now be sent
   to Elasticsearch in the order they were generated, even when they come from different threads.
 ** Mass indexing will now add documents in parallel, allowing you to take advantage
   of having multiple connections to the Elasticsearch cluster.
   Note you can
   https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration-configuration[customize the maximum number of connections]
   using the `hibernate.search.default.elasticsearch.max_total_connection`
   and `hibernate.search.default.elasticsearch.max_total_connection_per_route`
   configuration properties.
 ** The internal index update queues are now bounded,
   thus performing mass indexing on very large data sets will not
   trigger an `OutOfMemoryError` anymore.
 ** We also made several other internal changes to improve performance
   (less Refresh API calls, more request bulking, ...).
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2839[HSEARCH-2839]: when using a metadata-providing
  bridge, the bridge can now implement projection on the default field even if its type was set to `OBJECT`.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2840[HSEARCH-2840]: when using a metadata-providing
  bridge, the bridge can now implement projection on
  https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-custom-field-bridge-dynamic-mapping[dynamic fields].
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2843[HSEARCH-2843]: changing the limit/offset
  of a query now properly clears the query's result cache with Elasticsearch.
