We just published a bugfix release for Hibernate Search: 6.0.3.Final.

Thanks to Griffin DeJohn, Keith Melkild and Jan Kunzmann for their reports!

== What's new

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4173[HSEARCH-4173]:
  Multi-index Elasticsearch queries no longer return incomplete results when a field is present in only one index.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4183[HSEARCH-4183]:
  `SearchResult.took()` now returns the correct value with the Lucene backend.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4196[HSEARCH-4196]:
  Upgrade to ORM 5.4.30.Final.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4211[HSEARCH-4211]:
  The mass indexer now commits transactions instead of rolling them back when loading entities.
  The transactions are still read-only; this was only changed to work around
  bugs in Hibernate ORM (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14557[HHH-14557])
  that arise only in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/16463[some setups].
