We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Alpha5, the fifth release for the still-in-development 6.0 branch.
This release mainly restores the "indexNullAs" feature,
adds a brand new API to declare dependencies in bridges,
and adds compatibility with Elasticsearch 6.7 and 7.0.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 is still in development and its APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about the current status of this branch, see
https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[the page dedicated to Search 6 on hibernate.org].

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== "indexNullAs" is back

The https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3099["indexNullAs" feature is back],
allowing to replace null properties with a value of your choice when indexing:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
@GenericField(indexNullAs = "1900-01-01")
public LocalDate getBirthDate() {
	return birthDate;
}
----

The "indexNullAs" attribute is passed as a String in the annotation,
but the String is expected to be formatted according to the property type
(integer, date, etc.).
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-indexnullas[the documentation]
for more information.

Note that:

* Support for "default" null tokens configured in the configuration properties was removed,
because it no longer makes sense when each field requires a null token of a different type
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3553[HSEARCH-3553]).
* Support for "indexNullAs" in `@IndexedEmbedded` was removed because it was poorly defined in some corner cases
(like when `@IndexedEmbedded.prefix` does not contain any dot)
and cannot be implemented for Elasticsearch
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2465[HSEARCH-2465]).
An "exists" predicate for object fields will be added in a future release to compensate
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2389[HSEARCH-2389]).

=== Simpler API to declare dependencies in bridges

In an effort to make bridges easier to use,
we added a more direct way to declare the properties a `TypeBridge` or `PropertyBridge` will use.

This feature, and bridges in general, will be documented in more details once we feel they are ready,
but if you are interested you can already find examples
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/blob/6.0.0.Alpha5/integrationtest/showcase/library/src/main/java/org/hibernate/search/integrationtest/showcase/library/bridge/AccountBorrowalSummaryBridge.java#L42[in the showcase]

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3518[HSEARCH-3518] and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3568[HSEARCH-3568]:
Add compatibility with Elasticsearch 6.7
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3541[HSEARCH-3541]: Add compatibility with Elasticsearch 7.0

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3534[HSEARCH-3534]:
Default value for "minimumShouldMatch" is different between Elasticsearch and Lucene.
Elasticsearch, before version 7, used to use non-trivial rules to determine whether a "should" clause is required to match,
notably taking into account whether this clause is nested in a "filter" clause.
This was different from the behavior of the Lucene backend, and (even worse) different from the behavior in Elasticsearch 7+.
We made sure to override the defaults so that every predicate created with the Hibernate Search DSL
will behave as Lucene.
Thanks to Goran Jaric for reporting this.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3563[HSEARCH-3563]:
When Elasticsearch dialects are configured explicitly,
you no longer need to point to a dialect explicitly but can simply provide the Elasticsearch version you expect,
and Hibernate Search will pick the right dialect for you.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1656[HSEARCH-1656]:
Recognize annotations from implemented interfaces.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2941[HSEARCH-2941]:
`MassIndexerProgressMonitor` methods now consistently use the `long` type.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3566[HSEARCH-3566]:
Reindexing is now triggered when an association mentioned in an `@IndexingDependency.derivedFrom` is updated.

And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases,
