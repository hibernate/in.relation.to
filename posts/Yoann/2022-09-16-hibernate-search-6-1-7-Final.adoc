We just published a maintenance release for Hibernate Search:
6.1.7.Final.

This release mainly upgrades to Hibernate ORM 5.6.11.Final,
replaces dependency management of Hibernate ORM dependencies with simple alignment in all artifacts (including -orm6 artifacts),
and fixes a bug related to Java modules.

== Thanks

Thanks to https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?accountId=70121%3Ad48390c0-1583-4a3f-b95b-71b88672ea08[Yasin Koyuncu]
for his help reporting bugs!

== What's new

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4692[HSEARCH-4692]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.6.11.Final
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4691[HSEARCH-4691]:
Hibernate Search no longer attempts to manage Hibernate ORM dependencies,
but is simply aligned on the dependencies of Hibernate ORM 5.6.11.Final
(or 6.0.2.Final for `-orm6` artifacts).
This should make upgrading Hibernate ORM without upgrading Hibernate Search
slightly easier for frameworks and application developers.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4701[HSEARCH-4701]:
When running Hibernate Search as a Java module (in the modulepath),
Elasticsearch schema management will no longer lead to exceptions
caused by missing inter-module dependencies.
