We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta4.

This release mainly fixes a performance regression in the Lucene backend
and introduces an API for plugging in custom behavior on failures during mass indexing.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Fixed a performance regression in the Lucene backend

A performance regression was introduced in version 6.0.0.Beta3 that would slow down search queries
performed on large indexes.
This was fixed in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3797[HSEARCH-3797].

Performance for projections on nested fields was also improved as part of
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3786[HSEARCH-3786].

=== Custom behavior on mass indexing failure

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3729[HSEARCH-3729],
the mass indexer allows customizing the behavior on failure through
the new `MassIndexingFailureHandler` interface.

See the `failureHandler` parameter
in the link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-massindexer-parameters[MassIndexer documentation].

=== Version upgrades

No version upgrades this time.

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3629[HSEARCH-3629]:
Search query loading options (cache lookup, fetch size, ...)
are now passed through a dedicated `loading(...)` method accepting a lambda expression.
See link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-query-entity-loading-options[this section of the documentation]
for more information.
The previous syntax still works, but has been deprecated and will be removed soon.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3461[HSEARCH-3461]:
The `optimize` index operation has been renamed to `mergeSegments` throughout the API.
Also, by default, index segments will no longer be merged after mass indexing.
This can still be enabled explicitly through massIndexer.mergeSegments
For more information about this operation,
see link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-merge-segments[this section of the documentation].

=== Documentation

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3418[HSEARCH-3418]:
The limitations in terms of range and resolution for date/time field types is now clearly documented.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-elasticsearch-field-types-available[here for Elasticsearch]
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-field-types-available[here for Lucene].
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3793[HSEARCH-3793]:
The section of the documentation about the link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-predicate-exists[`exists` predicate]
now mentions that it can be used against object fields.

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3802[HSEARCH-3802]:
Elasticsearch backend: `query.fetchTotalHitCounts()` used to always fail when a timeout was set,
even when the fetch did not time out. This was fixed.

And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases,
