We just published a bugfix release for Hibernate Search: 6.0.4.Final.

Thanks to Aaron Kunde for his report!

== What's new

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4236[HSEARCH-4236]:
The mass indexer no longer leaks threads if it fails due to unavailable database connections.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4204[HSEARCH-4204]:
The metamodel for Elasticsearch indexes now exposes the name of the index used by Hibernate Search to read and write documents.
This should be useful to applications that also send requests directly to Elasticsearch through an HTTP client.
See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#_retrieving_the_read_and_write_index_names[this section of the documentation]
for more information.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4213[HSEARCH-4213]:
Upgrade to Jackson 2.12.x
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4219[HSEARCH-4219]:
