We just published the first candidate release for Hibernate Search 6.0: version 6.0.0.CR1.

Compared to Hibernate Search 5, changes are extensive,
due to the API overhaul, but with plenty of improvements:
upgrades to Lucene 8 and Elasticsearch 7 of course,
but also a more concise Search DSL with typed result types,
full control on field declaration in Bridges,
easier to configure and more efficient automatic indexing,
runtime joins with nested documents, ...

No more changes are planned before the final release,
so *this is the perfect time to test your applications based on Hibernate Search*,
and report problems as soon as possible
so that everything works perfectly as soon as 6.0.0.Final is released.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

If you want to migrate an application based on Hibernate Search 5,
be aware that Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.
We recommend you have a look at
see link:{hsearch-migration-url-prefix}[the migration guide].

[NOTE]
.Attention Spring users
====
Be aware that https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/25111[a bug in Spring]
may cause your application to hang on bootstrap, unless you add specific configuration.
This affects Spring Boot 2.3.5.RELEASE and probably earlier 2.3.x versions as well.

Until the Spring project resolves this deadlock, the best workaround is to set the property
`spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode` to `deferred`
in your `application.properties`/`application.yaml`.

We are also trying to implement a workaround within Hibernate Search,
at least for applications that do not use custom beans in Hibernate Search.
To track progress on this issue, see link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4096[HSEARCH-4096].

== Reporting bugs

While this version has been tested extensively, and we don't anticipate any particular problem,
the goal of this candidate release is to catch as many bugs as possible before the final release.

If you happen to encounter problems, please contact us:

* When you're unsure whether it's a usage issue or a bug,
ask questions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-search[Stack Overflow]
with the `hibernate-search` tag
or on https://discourse.hibernate.org/c/hibernate-search[our forums] in the "Hibernate Search" category.
* When you're clearly facing a bug,
report it https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH[on JIRA].
* For more communication channels, see https://hibernate.org/community/[here].

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 5

For an overview of new features and improvements in Hibernate Search 6,
see https://hibernate.org/search/releases/6.0/#whats-new[here].

== What's new compared to Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta11

Compared to the last beta,
this version includes the batch for Java (JSR-352) integration to the ORM mapper,
and an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.23.Final.

[[jsr-352]]
=== Batch for Java (JSR-352) mass indexing job

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3269[HSEARCH-3269],
Hibernate Search 6 once again includes a JSR-352 mass indexing job,
through a dedicated module.

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-indexing-jsr352[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

[[built-in-analyzers]]
=== Built-in analyzer definitions for Lucene

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-2584[HSEARCH-2584],
the Lucene backend now provides a few built-in analyzer definitions, for convenience.

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-lucene-analysis-builtin[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

[[scroll-total-hit-count]]
=== Scrolls now provide a total hit count

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4023[HSEARCH-4023],
`SearchScrollResult` now provides a total hit count:

[source, JAVA]
----
try ( SearchScroll<Book> scroll = searchSession.search( Book.class )
        .where( f -> f.matchAll() )
        .scroll( 20 ) ) {
    for ( SearchScrollResult<Book> chunk = scroll.next();
            chunk.hasHits(); chunk = scroll.next() ) {
        for ( Book hit : chunk.hits() ) {
            // ... do something with the hits ...
        }

        long totalHitCount = chunk.total().hitCount();

        entityManager.flush();
        entityManager.clear();
    }
}
----

[[es-path-prefix]]
=== Configurable path prefix for the Elasticsearch backend

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4051[HSEARCH-4051],
for non-standard setups where the REST API endpoint is not the root (`/`),
a path prefix can now be configured.

See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-configuration-path-prefix[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

[[breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking changes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4041[HSEARCH-4041]:
Deprecated classes, interfaces and methods that were introduced during the Alphas/Betas
of Hibernate Search 6 were removed. This includes in particular:
** `RoutingKeyBridge` => Use `RoutingBridge` instead.
** API methods starting with `get`/`set`/`is` =>
   Use the corresponding method without the `get`/`set`/`is` prefix instead.
** `ObjectFieldStorage` => Use `ObjectStructure` instead.
** `SearchResult#totalHitCount()` => Use `.total().hitCount()` instead.
** `org.hibernate.search.mapper.orm.mapping.SearchIndexedEntity` =>
   Use `org.hibernate.search.mapper.orm.entity.SearchIndexedEntity` instead.
** `BuiltinContainerExtractors.ARRAY` => Use `BuiltinContainerExtractors.ARRAY_OBJECT` instead.
** `@IndexedEmbedded(maxDepth = ...)` => Use `@IndexedEmbedded(includeDepth = ...)` instead.
** `@IndexedEmbedded(storage = ...)` => Use `@IndexedEmbedded(structure = ...)` instead.
** Search DSL:
*** `asEntity()`/`asEntityReference()`/`asProjection(...)`/`asProjections(...)` =>
    Use `selectEntity()`/`selectEntityReference()`/`select(...)` instead.
*** `.predicate( f -> ...)` => Use `.where( f -> ... )` instead.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4071[HSEARCH-4071]:
Deprecated configuration properties that were introduced during the Alphas/Betas
of Hibernate Search 6 were removed. This includes:

   using `+hibernate.search.backend.+`.
