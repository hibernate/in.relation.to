We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta5.

This release mainly changes the way the Elasticsearch backend accesses indexes,
introduces delayed commits and near-real-time queries for the Lucene backend,
and renames a few methods in the Search DSL.
It also includes upgrades to Lucene 8.4, Elasticsearch 7.6 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.12.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

[[aliases-elasticsearch]]
=== Aliases for Elasticsearch indexes

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3791[HSEARCH-3791],
Elasticsearch indexes are now accessed through aliases only.
Hibernate Search relies on two aliases for each index: one for writes (`<myindex>-write`) and one for reads (`<myindex>-read`).

This setup is a first step towards introducing, in a future version of Hibernate Search,
a "zero-downtime" reindexing where search queries still return results while reindexing.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout[this section of the reference documentation]
for more information, in particular regarding how to change the name of the aliases.

As a result of this change, you will need to either:

* manually create the two aliases for each index;
* or drop your indexes and have Hibernate Search re-create empty indexes on startup: it will create the aliases.
In this case, you will also need to
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-massindexer[reindex].

=== Delayed commits and near-real-time for the Lucene backend

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3775[HSEARCH-3775],
the Lucene backend can now be configured to commit the writer or refresh the reader periodically (e.g. every second),
instead of doing it as soon as possible.

This feature, which was already available but exposed differently in Search 5, can lead to substantial performance improvements.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-io[this section of the documentation]
for details.

[[nested-documents-lucene]]
=== Fixed an indexing bug for nested documents in the Lucene backend

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3834[HSEARCH-3834]
fixed a bug that caused nested documents to be left in the index indefinitely
after their root document was deleted.
This bug did not affect the results of search queries:
the nested documents were not visible after deletion of the root document.
However, this could lead to indexes taking more space than necessary.

In order to clean up your index,
you should https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-massindexer[reindex].

=== More generic wording in the Search DSL

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3807[HSEARCH-3807],
a few methods in the Search DSL have been renamed:

* `searchSession.search(...).predicate(...)` becomes `searchSession.search(...).where(...)`.
* `searchSession.search(...).asProjection(...)` becomes `searchSession.search(...).select(...)`.
* `searchSession.search(...).asProjections(...)` becomes `searchSession.search(...).select(...)`.
* `searchSession.search(...).asEntity(...)` becomes `searchSession.search(...).selectEntity()`.
* `searchSession.search(...).asEntityReference(...)` becomes `searchSession.search(...).selectEntityReference()`.

The methods with the old name are still present, though deprecated.
They will be removed before Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Final is released.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3799[HSEARCH-3799]: Upgrade to Lucene 8.4.1
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3829[HSEARCH-3829]: Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.6
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3830[HSEARCH-3830]: Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.12.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3808[HSEARCH-3808]:
The names of synchronization strategies for automatic indexing have changed:
+
 ** `queued` => `async`.
 ** `committed` (the default) => `write-sync` (still the default).
 ** `searchable` (commonly used for tests) => `sync` (still recommended for tests only).
+
You will need to update the value of the property `hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.synchronization.strategy`
in your configuration.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3460[HSEARCH-3460]:
an explicit https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-manual-flush[`flush()`] no longer implicitly refreshes the index;
you will need to use the new
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-manual-refresh[`refresh()`] operation.
* https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-massindexer[Full reindexing] is necessary if you use the Lucene backend and take advantage
of nested documents (`@IndexedEmbedded(storage = NESTED)`).
See <<nested-documents-lucene,above>> for details.
* Dropping and re-creating your indexes is necessary if you use the Elasticsearch backend.
See <<aliases-elasticsearch,above>> for details or workarounds.

=== Documentation

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3808[HSEARCH-3808]:
The https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-automatic-synchronization[documentation of automatic indexing synchronization strategies]
was improved and should now be clearer.
