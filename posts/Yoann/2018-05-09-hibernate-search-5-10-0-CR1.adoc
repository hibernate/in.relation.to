We just published 5.10.0.CR1, the first candidate release for the 5.10 branch.
This release mainly includes an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.3.0.CR2,
but it also adds a few bugfixes and improvements: see below!

== What's new?

Here are some notable changes since Hibernate Search 5.10.0.Beta1:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3143[HSEARCH-3143]:
Hibernate Search's ORM integration now depends on Hibernate ORM 5.3.0.CR2.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3125[HSEARCH-3125]:
Hibernate Search now offers a way to access the Elasticsearch client directly.
See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.10/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-client-access[documentation]
for more information.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3138[HSEARCH-3138]:
We restored binary compatibility with applications built against Hibernate Search 5.5,
so that Hibernate Search 5.10 can be included in the upcoming WildFly release.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3000[HSEARCH-3000]:
We added automatic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System[JPMS module] names to our JARs.
Note that Hibernate Search JARs still can only be used as automatic modules,
because some of our dependencies cannot easily be used as modules yet.
Here are the module names:
** `org.hibernate.search.engine`
** `org.hibernate.search.orm`
** `org.hibernate.search.backend.elasticsearch`
** `org.hibernate.search.backend.elasticsearch.aws`
** `org.hibernate.search.clustering.jms`
** `org.hibernate.search.clustering.jgroups`
** `org.hibernate.search.jsr352.core`
** `org.hibernate.search.jsr352.jberet`
** `org.hibernate.search.serialization.avro`
