== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Search analyzer

Since https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3042[HSEARCH-3042],
it is now possible to define a "search analyzer" for each field,
so that one analyzer is used when indexing, and another one when querying.
This is particularly useful when implementing autocomplete ("search-as-you-type")
with an edge-ngram token filter.

For example:

====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
@Entity
@Indexed
public class Book {

	@Id
	private Long id;

	@FullTextField(
			name = "title_autocomplete",
			analyzer = "autocomplete", // <1>
			searchAnalyzer = "autocomplete_query" // <2>
	)
	private String title;

	// ... getters and setters ...
}
----
<1> Apply the `autocomplete` analyzer (defined elsewhere) when indexing,
which will normalize text, then generate edge n-grams.
<2> Apply the `autocomplete-query` analyzer (defined elsewhere) when querying,
which will normalize text but will *not* generate edge n-grams.
====

In the example above:

* when indexing,
the indexed text `QuicK FOX`
will generate the tokens `q`, `qu`, `qui`, `quic`, `quick`, `f`, `fo`, `fox`,
and the indexed text `quid pro quo`
will generate the tokens `q`, `qu`, `qui`, `quid`, `p`, `pr`, `pro`, `q`, `qu`, `quo`.
* when querying,
the query string `quic` will only generate the token `quic`.

As a result, the query string `quic` will match a document containing `QuicK FOX`,
but not a document containing only `quid pro quo`.

Without the search analyzer,
the query string `quic` would have been analyzed using the `autocomplete` analyzer,
which would have generated the tokens `q`, `qu`, `qui`, `quic`.
Thus the query would have matched `quid pro quo` (it has the tokens `q`, `qu` and `qui` in common with the query),
which is obviously not the intended behavior.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#configuration-background-failure-handling[this paragraph]
of the documentation for more information about search analyzers,
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#concepts-analysis[the "analysis" section]
for more information about analysis in general.

[[background-failure-handling]]
=== Background failure handling

Support for background failure handling similar to Hibernate Search 5 has been restored
with significant improvements.

Like in Hibernate Search 5:

* Failures happening in background threads that cannot propagate the exception to a user thread
(e.g. failures in a Lucene merge thread).
will be logged.
* You can plug in a custom component to report the exceptions differently: the `FailureHandler`,
similar to Search 5's `ErrorHandler`.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#configuration-background-failure-handling[the dedicated section in the documentation]
for more information.

However, compared to Hibernate Search 5, a lot more failures will be propagated to the user thread
(Hibernate Search will throw an exception with details about the failure).
In particular:

* indexing failures during automatic indexing when using the `committed` or `searchable`
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-automatic-synchronization[synchronization strategy]
(see that section of the documentation for details).
* failures of https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-indexing-manual[explicit indexing operations].
* failure of a purge, optimize or flush operation during mass indexing.
In this case, failures will *also* be reported to the failure handler.
* entity indexing failure during mass indexing.
In this case, failures will *also* be reported to the failure handler.

[NOTE]
====
In Hibernate Search 5,
mass indexing didn't stop just because indexing one entity failed.

Likewise, in the event of an entity indexing failure during mass indexing,
Hibernate Search 6 will still attempt to reindex every relevant entity.
The difference is that it will throw an exception when mass indexing finishes,
with a count of failed entities
and details about the very first failure.
Details about other failures are still pushed to the failure handler.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3742[HSEARCH-3742]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.7.Final
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3723[HSEARCH-3723]:
Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.4.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3724[HSEARCH-3724]:
Upgrade to Jackson 2.9.10.

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3720[HSEARCH-3720]:
The `hibernate-search-mapper-pojo` module has a new artifact ID: `hibernate-search-mapper-pojo-base`.
This should affect very few applications, since this module is generally pulled as a transitive dependency.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3721[HSEARCH-3721]:
All deprecated methods that were already present in 6.0.0.Beta1 were removed.
** Search session:
*** `Search.getSearchSession(...)`: use `Search.session(...)` instead.
*** `createIndexer(...)`: use `massIndexer(...)` instead.
** When fetching query results:
*** `fetch()` (without any parameter): consider passing a limit (e.g. `fetch(20)`).
If you really want to fetch all hits, use `fetchAll()`.
*** `fetchHits()` (without any parameter): consider passing a limit (e.g. `fetchHits(20)`).
If you really want to fetch all hits, use `fetchAllHits()`.
** In the predicate DSL:
*** `onField(String)`/`onFields(String...)`/`orField(String)`/`orFields(String...)`/`onObjectField(String)`/:
use `field(String)`/`fields(String...)`/`objectField(String)` instead.
*** `boostedTo(float)`: use `boost(float)` instead.
*** `withConstantScore()`: use `constantScore()` instead.
*** `withSlop(int)`: use `slop(int)` instead.
*** `from(...)`/`above(...)`/`below(...)` for the range predicate:
use `between(...)`/`atLeast(...)`/`atMost(...)`/`greaterThan(...)`/`lessThan(...)` instead,
or `range(...)` for the more complex use cases.
*** `withAndAsDefaultOperator()`: use `defaultOperator(BooleanOperator.AND)` instead.
** In the sort DSL:
*** `by*()` methods, e.g. `byField(...)`, `byDistance(...)`, etc.:
use the version without a `by` prefix instead, e.g. `field(...)`, `distance(...)`.
*** `onMissingValue()`/`sortLast()`/`sortFirst()`: use `missing()`/`last()`/`first()` instead.
** In the Elasticsearch analysis definition DSL: `withTokenizer`, `withTokenFilters`, `withCharFilters`.
Use the methods without the `with` prefix instead.
* `AutomaticIndexingSynchronizationStrategy`, which could theoretically be implemented by users for advanced use cases,
was overhauled to allow for improvements related to <<background-failure-handling,background failure handling>>.
See the javadoc for more information about this interface and how to implement it.
