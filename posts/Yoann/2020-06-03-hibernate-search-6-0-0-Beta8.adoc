We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta8.

This release mainly adds support for entity graphs in search queries
and changes `@Indexed` so that it's inherited.
It also includes an upgrade to Lucene 8.5.2, Elasticsearch 7.7.0 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.17.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Finer loading options in search queries

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3628[HSEARCH-3628],
entity graphs can be passed to search queries to control the associations that will be loaded eagerly.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Indexed
@NamedEntityGraph(
		name = "preload-associates",
		attributeNodes = @NamedAttributeNode("associates")
)
public class Manager {

	@Id
	private Integer id;

	@FullTextField(analyzer = "name", projectable = Projectable.YES)
	private String name;

	@OneToMany // The association's fetch type is lazy by default.
	@OrderColumn
	private List<Associate> associates = new ArrayList<>();

	// ...
}
----

[source,java]
----
List<Manager> hits = Search.session( entityManager ).search( Manager.class )
        .where( f -> f.match()
                .field( "name" )
                .matching( "james" ) )
        .loading( o -> o.graph( "preload-associates", GraphSemantic.FETCH ) )
        .fetchHits( 20 );

for ( Manager manager : hits ) {
    // This does not trigger a SELECT: the association was eagerly loaded.
    List<Associate> associates = manager.getAssociates();
    // ...
}
----

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#_entity_graph[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

=== `@Indexed` is now inherited by default

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1231[HSEARCH-1231],
as soon as an entity is `@Indexed`,
all of its extending entities will be indexed too, by default.
This behavior should be less surprising to new users.

If you really need an entity to be indexed and *not* one of its extending entities,
you can disable indexing for the extending entity manually
using `@Indexed(enabled = false)`.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-entityindexmapping[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3930[HSEARCH-3930]:
Upgrade to Lucene Lucene 8.5.2
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3918[HSEARCH-3918]:
Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.7.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3932[HSEARCH-3932]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.17.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible changes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3922[HSEARCH-3922]:
API methods no longer use a "get"/"set" prefix.
For example `SearchResult.getHits()` is now simply `SearchResult.hits()`.
Older versions of methods with the "get"/"set" prefix are still available for now,
but have been deprecated and will be removed before Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Final is released.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3097[HSEARCH-3097]:
`@IndexedEmbedded.name` should be used instead of `@IndexedEmbedded.prefix`.
The main difference is that `name` does not accept dot-separated paths, a prefix or an empty path:
it just defines the name of an object field.
`@IndexedEmbedded.prefix` is still available for now,
but has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3913[HSEARCH-3913]:
`@FullTextField.aggregable` has been removed because it didn't do anything.
If you need both full-text search and sorts/aggregations on a given property,
create two fields: one with `@FullTextField(analyzer = ...)`
and the other with `@KeywordField(sortable = Sortable.YES, aggregable = Aggregable.YES)`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3928[HSEARCH-3928]:
`PropertyMappingIndexedEmbeddedStep#extractors()` (no parameters) has been renamed to `noExtractors()`.

=== Documentation

No significant documentation changes apart from those related to new features.

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3072[HSEARCH-3072]:
`@IndexedEmbedded.targetType` is now available,
with similar functionality to `targetElement` in Hibernate Search 5.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-962[HSEARCH-962]:
Entity loading will now execute multiple queries to respect the configured fetch size,
even when the document ID is mapped to a property that is not the entity ID.
This will allow working around limitations of some databases
which put limits on the total amount of query parameters.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3584[HSEARCH-3584]:
Hibernate Search will now correctly retrieve data from properties defined in mapped superclasses or entity superclasses
when "extended" bytecode enhancement (replacing access to public fields) is enabled.

And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases,
