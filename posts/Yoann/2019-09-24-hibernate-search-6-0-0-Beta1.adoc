Hibernate Search 6 just reached Beta status with the release of version 6.0.0.Beta1.
This release clears the last remaining major hurdles:
it fixes the few remaining inconsistencies in APIs,
and completes the documentation of the major features.
This release also introduces aggregations,
similar to Search 5's faceting feature.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== What the Beta status means

Essentially, reaching Beta status means Hibernate Search 6 will be more stable from now on:

* The most commonly used APIs are not expected to change anymore.
* The implementations are well-tested and work as expected.
* The reference documentation covers all common use cases and most advanced use cases,
and shouldn't change much before the final release.

It's still a Beta, not a Candidate Release,
because a significant amount of work still remains before the final release:

* Some of the less commonly used features such as scrolling or error handlers are still missing.
* Some improvements over Search 5 such as search analyzers or zero-downtime mass indexing are still missing.
* Performance is satisfying (no obvious bottlenecks),
but needs more thorough testing.
* Depending on the changes needed to solve the above,
we may still change the index format in later Betas,
which will require reindexing.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

== What's new

=== Aggregation DSL

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3649[HSEARCH-3649],
Hibernate Search 6 now offers a DSL to build aggregations,
i.e. aggregated results based on *all* hits for a given search query.

Supported aggregations are rather simple for now, but more will be added later:

* Terms aggregations produce a count of the number of hits
for each value of a given field:
+
[source, JAVA]
----
AggregationKey<Map<Genre, Long>> countsByGenreKey =
        AggregationKey.of( "countsByGenre" );
SearchResult<Book> result = searchSession.search( Book.class )
        .predicate( f -> f.matchAll() )
        .aggregation( countsByGenreKey, f -> f.terms()
                .field( "genre", Genre.class ) )
        .fetch( 20 );
Map<Genre, Long> countsByGenre = result.getAggregation( countsByGenreKey );
----

* Given a set of ranges, range aggregations produce a count of the number of hits
for each range of values of a given field:
+
[source, JAVA]
----
AggregationKey<Map<Range<Double>, Long>> countsByPriceKey =
        AggregationKey.of( "countsByPrice" );
SearchResult<Book> result = searchSession.search( Book.class )
        .predicate( f -> f.matchAll() )
        .aggregation( countsByPriceKey, f -> f.range()
                .field( "price", Double.class )
                .range( 0.0, 10.0 )
                .range( 10.0, 20.0 )
                .range( 20.0, null )
        )
        .fetch( 20 );
Map<Range<Double>, Long> countsByPrice = result.getAggregation( countsByPriceKey );
----

This provides all the features that were provided by Hibernate Search 5's  "faceting" feature,
with the exception of https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.11/reference/en-US/html_single/#_restricting_query_results["drill-down"],
which is straightforward to reproduce using the predicate DSL.
In addition, the new aggregation feature solves several long-standing issues of faceting in Search 5:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1372[HSEARCH-1372]/link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2111[HSEARCH-2111]:
The aggregation API uses clear, consistent naming.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2472[HSEARCH-2472]/link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2954[HSEARCH-2954]:
Encoding is no longer limited to just numeric fields or text:
fields with Java 8 date/time types can be aggregated too,
for example `LocalDate`,
and they use the dedicated `date` datatype in the Elasticsearch backend.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1748[HSEARCH-1748]:
Attempts to create aggregations on unsupported fields
will now trigger an exception during query building,
instead of just returning empty results.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2446[HSEARCH-2446]:
Aggregations (faceting) can now be used on fields declared by bridges.
* Discrete aggregations no longer require to index numbers as text.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3706[HSEARCH-3706]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.5.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

There are quite a few backward-incompatible changes this time,
as this was the last set of changes before the Betas.

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3705[HSEARCH-3705]:
The default index name for indexed entity types
is now **the entity name instead of the fully qualified class name**.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3707[HSEARCH-3707]:
The limit and offset parameters in `SearchQuery.fetch(Integer, Integer)` **have been swapped**.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3669[HSEARCH-3669]:
The `fetch()`/`fetchHits()` methods are now deprecated:
use  `fetchAll`/`fetchAllHits` instead.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3606[HSEARCH-3606]:
The `SearchWriter` was renamed to `SearchWorkspace`,
and `SearchSessionWritePlan` was renamed to `SearchIndexingPlan`.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3623[HSEARCH-3623]:
The syntax of analysis definition DSLs was updated:
** It is no longer possible to chain analyzer/normalizer definition with the Lucene analysis definition DSL.
** The methods prefixed with `with` in the Elasticsearch analysis definition DSL were deprecated
in favor of new methods without this prefix (`withTokenizer()` => `tokenizer()`).
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3671[HSEARCH-3671]:
`SearchScope` is now session-independent.
The main implication is you can no longer write `scope.search()`:
use `searchSession.search(scope)` instead.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3691[HSEARCH-3691]:
`@GeoPointBinding` can no longer be used on properties of type `GeoPoint`:
use `@GenericField` instead.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3687[HSEARCH-3687]:
Generic type parameters of DSL step interfaces have changed.
This will only affect you if you store DSL steps in variables,
which is not recommended (you should just chain calls).
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3708[HSEARCH-3708]:
The range predicate DSL now exposes a new syntax to define the range to match,
leveraging the new `Range` class.
The old syntax still works but it is deprecated.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1347[HSEARCH-1347]:
** `org.hibernate.search.mapper.pojo.dirtiness.ReindexOnUpdate` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.mapper.pojo.automaticindexing.ReindexOnUpdate`

** Package `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.dsl.predicate` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.predicate.dsl`
** Package `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.dsl.sort` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.sort.dsl`
** Package `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.dsl.projection` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.projection.dsl`
** Package `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.dsl.aggregation` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.backend.lucene.search.aggregation.dsl`
** `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.SearchPredicate` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.predicate.SearchPredicate`
** `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.SearchSort` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.sort.SearchSort`
** `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.SearchProjection` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.projection.SearchProjection`
** `org.hibernate.search.engine.search.DocumentReference` was moved to `org.hibernate.search.engine.backend.common.DocumentReference`
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3441[HSEARCH-3441]:
DSL methods now use consistent wording.
** In the programmatic mapping API:
*** `withExtractor()` was renamed to `extractor()`
*** `withExtractors()` was renamed to `extractors()`
*** `withoutExtractors()` was renamed to `noExtractors()`
** In the predicate DSL:
*** `onField()`/`orField()`/`onFields()`/`orFields()` are now deprecated.
Use the prefix-less versions instead (e.g. `onField()` => `field()`).
*** `withConstantScore()` is now deprecated: use `constantScore()` instead.
*** `boostedTo()` is now deprecated: use `boost()` instead.
*** `withAndAsDefaultOperator()` is now deprecated: use `defaultOperator(BooleanOperator)` instead.
*** `withSlop()` is now deprecated: use `slop()` instead.
** In the sort DSL:
*** Methods prefixed with `by` are now deprecated.
Use the prefix-less versions instead (e.g. `byField()` => `field()`).
*** `onMissingValue()` is now deprecated: use `missing()` instead.
*** `sortLast()` is now deprecated: use `last()` instead.
*** `sortFirst()` is now deprecated: use `first()` instead.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-859[HSEARCH-859]:
Some configuration properties were changed for better consistency.
** Configuration properties that were simply renamed:
*** `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.analysis_configurer` -> `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.analysis.configurer`
*** `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.multi_tenancy_strategy` -> `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.multi_tenancy.strategy`
*** `hibernate.search.mapping_configurer` -> `hibernate.search.mapping.configurer`
*** `hibernate.search.enable_annotation_mapping` -> `hibernate.search.mapping.process_annotations`
*** `hibernate.search.autoregister_listeners` -> `hibernate.search.enable`
** `hibernate.search.enable_configuration_property_tracking` was renamed to `hibernate.search.configuration_property_checking.strategy`
and expected values also changed: default is `warn`, use `ignore` to disable checks.
** Enums for configuration properties were relocated to appropriate packages.
** Property keys listed in `*Settings` classes
now include the `hibernate.search.` prefix where relevant.
Use `*Settings.Radicals` for property keys without any prefix.
