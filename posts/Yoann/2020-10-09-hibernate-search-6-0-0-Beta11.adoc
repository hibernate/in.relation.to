We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta11.

This release mainly brings a default analyzer,
a way to limit automatic reindexing to same-entity updates only,
a new implementation for AWS IAM authentication,
and a migration helper for applications moving from Search 5 to Search 6.

It also includes an upgrade to Lucene 8.6.2, and Hibernate ORM 5.4.22.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Hibernate Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

[[default-analyzer]]
=== Default analyzer

Both the Lucene backend and the Elasticsearch backend now have a default analyzer definition,
which can be used even if you didn't configure link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#concepts-analysis[analysis].

Thanks to this new default analyzer, the `analyzer` attribute in `@FullTextField(analyzer = ...)` no longer needs to be set:
for simple use cases, you can just use `@FullTextField` without any argument,
which will create an index field using the default analyzer.

This should make experimenting with Hibernate Search easier,
even if it's unlikely that a single default analyzer will be enough for real-world applications.

For more information about the default analyzer,
see link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-lucene-analysis-builtin[here for Lucene]
and link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-analysis-builtin[here for Elasticsearch].

[[reindexonupdate-shallow]]
=== `ReindexOnUpdate.SHALLOW`: limiting automatic reindexing to same-entity updates only

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4001[HSEARCH-4001],
it is now possible to apply `@IndexingDependency(reindexOnUpdate = ReindexOnUpdate.SHALLOW)` to an association.
If that association also has an `@IndexedEmbedded`, then:

* When the `@Indexed` entity is indexed,
the entities targeted by the association will be index-embedded as usual (no change here).
* When the association changes (associated entities are added or removed),
then the `@Indexed` entity will be automatically reindexed as usual (no change here.)
* When the associated entities are modified (e.g. their `name` property change),
the `@Indexed` entity *will not be automatically reindexed*.

This is especially useful for associations to "reference" entities (e.g. categories, types, cities, countries, ...)
which are not expected to change and cannot possibly expose the inverse side of the association (e.g. city => address),
which would be necessary for automatic reindexing.

For more information, head to
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#mapper-orm-reindexing-reindexonupdate[this section of the documentation].

[[aws-sdk]]
=== New implementation for AWS IAM authentication

The module `org.hibernate.search:hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch-aws` provides AWS IAM authentication,
so that applications can use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/[AWS Elasticsearch Service] as a backend,
which is an alternative to an on-premises cluster or https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service[Elastic's own cloud offering].

This module was re-implemented to rely on the AWS SDK instead of a third-party library.
This fixed a known bug of request signing (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3655[HSEARCH-3655]),
and opened the way to other ways of providing credentials.

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3560[HSEARCH-3560],
you can use all types of credentials supported by the AWS SDK,
in particular EC2 instance roles.
See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-configuration-aws[this section of the documentation] for more information.

NOTE: As a result of re-implementing this module, configuration properties related to AWS authentication have changed.
See <<breaking_changes>> for more details.

[[migration-helper]]
=== Migration helper for applications moving from Search 5 to Search 6

As of link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3282[HSEARCH-3282],
we publish two modules that provide *partial* compatibility with Hibernate Search 5 APIs
backed by the Hibernate Search 6 implementations.

These modules should make migration easier
by making sure that code relying on the most-used APIs (search DSL, ...) continues to compile and run.
The idea is to use the migration helper temporarily to make most of the application code (search queries, ...) work,
making it easier to focus on migrating configuration and to assess the effort required to migrate the remaining code.

IMPORTANT: These modules should not be used in production environments.
They have limitations preventing full compatibility with Hibernate Search 5,
and these limitations will never be addressed.
All code in these modules is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.

More information will come in the following weeks about how to use these modules when migrating,
and what their limitations are.
In particular, expect some updates to https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide] soon.

[[version_upgrades]]
=== Version upgrades

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3991[HSEARCH-3991]:
Upgrade to Lucene 8.6.2
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4030[HSEARCH-4030]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.22.Final

Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will lead to potentially cryptic runtime exceptions.
====

[[breaking_changes]]
=== Breaking changes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3560[HSEARCH-3560]:
  the properties to configure AWS authentication have changed:
** `hibernate.search.backend.aws.signing.region` is now `hibernate.search.backend.aws.region`.
** In order to specify credentials statically in configuration properties,
   you must set `hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.type` to `static` and also set the following two properties.
** `hibernate.search.backend.aws.signing.access_key` is now `hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.access_key_id`.
** `hibernate.search.backend.aws.signing.secret_key` is now `hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.secret_access_key`.
** `hibernate.search.backend.aws.signing.enabled` didn't change.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3994[HSEARCH-3994]:
  `org.hibernate.search.mapper.orm.mapping.SearchIndexedEntity` is now deprecated
  and will be removed before the release of Hibernate Search 6.0.0.CR1.
  Use `org.hibernate.search.mapper.orm.entity.SearchIndexedEntity` instead.
* The incubating interface `org.hibernate.search.mapper.pojo.extractor.ContainerExtractor` changed;
  see its javadoc for defails of the new interface.
* The `array` container extractor was renamed to `array-object`.
  Variants were introduced for arrays of each primitive type (`array-char`, `array-int`, `array-byte`, ...).
  See `org.hibernate.search.mapper.pojo.extractor.builtin.BuiltinContainerExtractors` for a list
  of all available container extractors.

=== Documentation

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3995[HSEARCH-3995]:
Required Lucene/Elasticsearch versions are now mentioned in the link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#getting-started-compatibility["Compatibility" section] of the documentation.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4013[HSEARCH-4013]:
The getting started guide now includes a
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#gettingstarted-framework[section related to specifics of some frameworks].

[[other-changes]]
=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3071[HSEARCH-3071]:
Support for `@IndexedEmbedded.includeEmbeddedObjectId` has been restored.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4025[HSEARCH-4025]:
Partial support for indexing entities with `@IdClass` if they have an explicit `@DocumentId`.
Mass indexing doesn't work at the moment (link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4033[HSEARCH-4033]).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4002[HSEARCH-4002]:
`MappingAnnotatedProperty` (used in annotation processors) now exposes the type of the property
for any given `ContainerExtractorPath`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4003[HSEARCH-4003]:
Repeatable annotations are now automatically expended when retrieved from  `MappingAnnotatedElement`
(used in annotation processors).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3994[HSEARCH-3994]:
`SearchScope` now exposes metadata about the targeted types through `SearchScope#includedTypes`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3122[HSEARCH-3122]:
It is now possible to configure the default value of the `dynamic` attribute of Elasticsearch mappings.
See link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-mapping-dynamic[this section of the documentation].
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3243[HSEARCH-3243]:
Hibernate Search will now reject identifier/value bridges whose compatibility
with the bound property cannot be validated.
As a rule of thumb, when implementing identifier/value bridges,
the generic type parameter `I` or `T` should always be set to a raw class.
For more advanced implementations, you should rely on an `IdentifierBinder` or `ValueBinder`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3864[HSEARCH-3864]:
A `java.lang.Error` thrown during mass indexing is no longer swallowed and are propagated to the caller.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3997[HSEARCH-3997]:
Mapping arrays of primitive types (int[]/float[]/etc.) now works as expected:
it no longer leads to a `ClassCastException` upon indexing.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3998[HSEARCH-3998]:
Mass indexing a (non-abstract) parent class in a type hierarchy
with a subclass annotated with `@Indexed(enabled = false)` will now correctly ignore that subclass.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3999[HSEARCH-3999]:
Deleting an entity whose `@ElementCollection` is indexed-embedded in another entity
no longer leads to `LazyInitializationException`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4009[HSEARCH-4009]:
Fixed a corner case where `@IndexingDependency(derivedFrom = ...)` would lead to bootstrap failure.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4011[HSEARCH-4011]:
Hibernate Search `ScrollableResults` now throw a JPA `QueryTimeoutException` on timeout instead of `SearchTimeoutException`.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4027[HSEARCH-4027]:
`ScrollResult.timedOut()` sometimes used to return false even though a timeout occurred with Lucene;
this was fixed.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4028[HSEARCH-4028]:
Elasticsearch's `SearchResultTotal` now correctly reports an approximate total hit count after a timeout.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3917[HSEARCH-3917]:
Performance improvement: Hibernate Search now uses `TopScoreDocCollector` instead of `TopFieldDocCollector`
when a descending score sort is requested explicitly
(not just when it's the implicit default).
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-3947[HSEARCH-3947]:
Performance improvement: Hibernate Search no longer creates huge arrays for collectors
when a query does not set a limit to the amount of retrieved hits and there are fewer than 10,000 hits.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4017[HSEARCH-4017]:
Performance improvement: the Lucene backend no longer scans index segments that don't contain any returned hit when extracting projections.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4018[HSEARCH-4018]:
Performance improvement: the Lucene backend now skips some filters when an index doesn't have any nested documents.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4019[HSEARCH-4019]:
Performance improvement: the Lucene backend now only uses a `TotalHitCountCollector` when absolutely necessary.
