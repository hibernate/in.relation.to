We just published Hibernate Search version 5.10.2.Final,
the second maintenance release of Hibernate Search 5.10.
This release adds previously missing handling of `minimumShouldMatch` constraints in boolean junctions.

== What's new?

Most of the changes are purely internal and related to building Hibernate Search from sources.

The only change impacting users is the introduction of `minimumShouldMatch` constraints in boolean junctions.
This was an issue for users of the Elasticsearch integration in particular,
since they could create a Lucene `BooleanQuery` with a `minimumShouldMatch` constraint,
but the constraint was ignored when the query was translated to Elasticsearch.
This is no longer the case.

We took this opportunity to backport the parts of the Query DSL that allow to set `minimumShouldMatch` constraints
from the next version of Hibernate Search.
You can now simply use code similar to this:

```
FullTextEntityManager fullTextEntityManager = Search.getFullTextEntityManager( entityManager );
QueryBuilder queryBuilder = fullTextEntityManager.getSearchFactory()
		.buildQueryBuilder().forEntity( MyEntity.class ).get();
Query luceneQuery = queryBuilder.bool()
		.minimumShouldMatchNumber( 2 ) // This is new
		.should( queryBuilder.keyword().onField( "foo" ).matching( "text1" ).createQuery() )
		.should( queryBuilder.keyword().onField( "bar" ).matching( "text2" ).createQuery() )
		.should( queryBuilder.keyword().onField( "foobar" ).matching( "text3" ).createQuery() )
		.createQuery();
FullTextQuery query = fullTextEntityManager.createFullTextQuery( query, MyEntity.class );
```

\... and the resulting query will only match documents that match at least two should clauses.

There are more advanced syntaxes, please refer to the javadoc of `org.hibernate.search.query.dsl.BooleanJunction`
for more detailed information.
