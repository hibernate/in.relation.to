We just published Hibernate Search 6.0.0.Beta3.
This release mainly brings schema improvements,
deep customization of Elasticsearch search requests,
more powerful bridge definitions,
and restores features such as the search query timeouts.
It also includes upgrades to Lucene 8.3.0, Elasticsearch 7.5 and Hibernate ORM 5.4.10.Final.

== Getting started with Hibernate Search 6

If you want to dive right into the new, shiny Hibernate Search 6,
a good starting point is the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started[getting started guide]
included in the reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search 6 APIs differ significantly from Search 5.

For more information about migration and what we intend to do to help you, see
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/6.0/[the migration guide].

== What's new

=== Schema improvements

We made several improvements to the metadata fields stored in each document (identifier, type, ...),
in order to only store what is strictly necessary
and to rely on doc-values rather than stored fields
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3657[HSEARCH-3657]).

Also, in the Elasticsearch backend, we added a new `_entity_type` field
to better handle multi-index search queries targeting index aliases (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3765[HSEARCH-3765])
and changed the name of fields used for discriminator-based multi-tenancy
(now `_tenant_id` and `_tenant_doc_id`, see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3788[HSEARCH-3788]).

These improvements come at a cost: when upgrading from Beta2 to Beta3,
**existing data will need to be reindexed**.

=== Deep customization of Elasticsearch search requests

In https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3496[HSEARCH-3496],
new APIs were introduced to allow the manipulation of the JSON of Elasticsearch search requests
and the retrieval of the response as raw JSON.
This will allow leveraging Elasticsearch features that are not (yet) available in the Search DSL,
such as suggesters,
while still taking advantage of the DSL where possible (`match` predicate, sorts, projections, ...).
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-query-elasticsearch-json[this section of the documentation]
for more information.

Also, since https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3662[HSEARCH-3662],
Elasticsearch aggregations can now be defined directly as JSON,
in order to access aggregation types that are not yet exposed through the DSL.
See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-aggregation-extensions-elasticsearch-from-json[this section of the documentation]
for examples.

=== More powerful bridge definitions

Bridges gained several improvements:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3135[HSEARCH-3135]:
The concept of custom mapping annotations was streamlined:
it is no longer limited to the type bridge and property bridge,
and can now also be used for value bridges too.
In fact, custom annotations can now apply pretty much every mapping feature:
bridges, indexed-embedded, marking a type as indexed, ...
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3717[HSEARCH-3717]:
`ValueBinder` is no longer limited to standard field types:
it can now bind a value to more exotic field types,
such as a "native" Elasticsearch field whose content is defined as JSON directly.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3766[HSEARCH-3766]:
Custom annotations are now optional for type and property bridges.
To apply a bridge that does not define a dedicated annotation,
just apply the built-in `@TypeBinding(...)`/`@PropertyBinding(...)` annotations
to the type/property, setting its attribute to a reference to your binder.
Bridges applied this way cannot be parameterized.

For up-to-date information about bridges and how to use them,
see https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-bridge[the dedicated section in the reference documentation].

=== `exists` predicate can now target object fields

The `exists` predicate introduced in Search 6 can now target object fields
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2389[HSEARCH-2389]).
An object field will be considered as existing in a given document
when it has at least one existing (non-null) sub-field in that document.

In the example below, all clients that have an order with at least one non-null indexed field
will be present in the result:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
List<Client> clientsWithAtLeastOneOrder = searchSession.search(Client.class)
    .predicate(f -> f.exists().field("orders"))
    .fetch( 20 );
----

=== Search query timeouts are back

As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3352[HSEARCH-3352],
it is once again possible to set timeouts on search queries,
similarly to what was possible in Search 5.

Two kinds of timeouts are available:

* `failAfter(long, TimeUnit)`: a "hard" timeout that will abort the search query and throw an exception;
* `truncateAfter(long, TimeUnit)`: a "soft" timeout that will stop the result collection and return a truncated result.

These timeouts are available for both the Lucene backend and the Elasticsearch backend.

Additionally, as of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3456[HSEARCH-3456],
the `SearchResult` interface now exposes information about the query execution time (`getTook()`)
and a flag indicating whether the query timed out (`isTimedOut()`).

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-query-timeout[the dedicated section in the reference documentation]
for more information.

=== Version upgrades

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3758[HSEARCH-3758]:
Upgrade to Lucene 8.3.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3782[HSEARCH-3782]:
Upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.5.0
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3781[HSEARCH-3781]:
Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.10.Final

[WARNING]
====
Hibernate Search 6 requires ORM 5.4.4.Final or later to work correctly.
Earlier 5.4.x versions will not work correctly.
====

=== Backward-incompatible API changes

* Configuration:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3756[HSEARCH-3756]:
Multi-valued configuration properties now must be specified using commas as a separator,
instead of blanks. This affects in particular the configuration of Elasticsearch hosts.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3757[HSEARCH-3757]:
The protocol used to contact Elasticsearch (`http` or `https`)
must now be specified separately in the dedicated `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>.protocol`
property.
It can no longer be specified as part of the `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>.hosts` property.
* Bridges:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3135[HSEARCH-3135]:
The `*Binder` interfaces no longer have a generic type parameter nor an `initialize()` method.
Processing of custom annotations, for bridges or otherwise,
are now implemented by meta-annotating the custom annotation with
`@TypeMapping` or `@PropertyMapping`
and implementing the dedicated interface
`TypeMappingAnnotationProcessor` or `PropertyMappingAnnotationProcessor`.
Binders that do not need to accept parameters can be applied directly
to a type/property using the built-in `@TypeBinding` or `@PropertyBinding` annotation.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3748[HSEARCH-3748]:
Some methods related to bridges in the programmatic API that couldn't possibly work were removed.
* Miscellaneous:
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3712[HSEARCH-3712]:
The API for defining DSL converters and projection converters on field types now uses different, simpler interfaces.
** https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3761[HSEARCH-3761]:
Elasticsearch APIs that produce or accept JSON now use GSON types (`JsonObject`, `JsonElement`, ...)
rather than Strings.

=== Documentation

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3750[HSEARCH-3750]:
Use auto-expanding entries in the documentation TOC
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3711[HSEARCH-3711]:
Index field type DSL extension are now documented:
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-lucene-field-types-extension[here for Lucene]
and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#backend-elasticsearch-field-types-extension[here for Elasticsearch].
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3753[HSEARCH-3753]:
APIs related to the definition of custom `ContainerExtractor` implementations
are now correctly marked as experimental.

=== Other improvements and bug fixes

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1401[HSEARCH-1401]:
Allow integrators to declare entities whose structure is defined programmatically ("free-form").
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3634[HSEARCH-3634]:
Clarify the error message when a `@javax.persistence.Transient` property is missing a `@IndexingDependency` annotation.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3764[HSEARCH-3764]:
It is now possible to disable value conversion in the `id()` predicate,
so as to pass the document ID (a string) directly.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3783[HSEARCH-3783]:
`query.explain()` with the Elasticsearch backend
no longer fails when using projections or multi-tenancy.
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3693[HSEARCH-3693]:
Some missing log messages from Search 5, in particular the Hibernate Search version displayed on startup,
were restored.
