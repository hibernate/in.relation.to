<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tsurdilovic/applying-drools-in-assistive-technology">Here</a> are the slides for my talk at this years JUDCon in Berlin. I was unfortunately not able to make it there in person, however Skype worked out great. Having to get up at 4am to test the connection was the hardest part ;) </div>

<p class="wikiPara">
The main topic of the talk was on how to apply Drools in Assistive Technology which is considered a <q>non-typical</q> technology field. It shows some of my past research and work in the area of assistive mouse-cursor control and shows how Drools as a fully fledged integration platform can further enhance the overall needs of current assistive technology devices and systems now and in the future.

If you are interested in Drools and Assistive Technology have a look and let me know what you think.
