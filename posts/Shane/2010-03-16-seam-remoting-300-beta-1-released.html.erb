<p class="wikiPara">
I'm pleased to announce the availability of our first Seam 3 module, Seam Remoting 3.0.0.Beta1. This release provides a CDI-based port of most of the AJAX remoting features that you know from Seam 2.x, and also introduces a new feature, the Model API.  Please refer to the following links for downloads and documentation, and if you encounter any issues please use the issue tracking link to let us know about them.  (Seam Remoting now has its own project in JIRA).
