<p class="wikiPara">
The Seam development team is pleased to announce the final release of Seam 3.0.  Seam is a modular collection of portable extensions and tooling for Java EE6.  This latest version represents a significant milestone in Seam's history, as it is the first release to be based on the standardized component model defined by the CDI (JSR-299 Java Contexts and Dependency Injection) specification.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Seam's goal is to enable developers to create rich, standards-based internet applications by solving many of the challenges encountered when developing software in today's connected world.  It achieves this by providing an integrated set of feature-centric modules, each targetted at a single area of concern.  This modular design also allows users the choice of using individual Seam modules based on the requirements of their project, without forcing them to adopt the overhead of a monolithic framework stack.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The following table contains a list of the modules included in the Seam 3.0 release, along with a brief description of their features.

<p class="wikiPara">
The Seam BOM (Bill Of Materials) is a Maven POM artifact that is provided as a convenience for your Seam application.  It declares the versions for all Seam modules and third party libraries that are used in the Seam stack.  To use Seam in your Maven-based project, it is first recommended that you define the Seam version you wish to use by declaring the following property value:
</p>



<pre class="wikiPreformatted">&lt;properties&gt;
   &lt;seam.version&gt;3.0.0.Final&lt;/seam.version&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</pre>



<p class="wikiPara">
Next, add the following section to your project's POM file to import the Seam BOM:
</p>



<pre class="wikiPreformatted">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
   &lt;dependencies&gt;
      &lt;dependency&gt;
         &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.seam&lt;/groupId&gt;
         &lt;artifactId&gt;seam-bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
         &lt;version&gt;${seam.version}&lt;/version&gt;
         &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
         &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
      &lt;/dependency&gt;
   &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</pre>




<p class="wikiPara">
After this, it is a simple matter of declaring which Seam modules you wish to use in your project.  For example, if you wish to use the Seam Catch module in your project, simply add the following dependency:
</p>



<pre class="wikiPreformatted">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.seam.catch&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;seam-catch&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>




<p class="wikiPara">

<p class="wikiPara">
The Seam development team consists of a small team of full-time developers, plus a rapidly growing number of community contributors! Many of the modules in Seam 3 are led by community members who love and believe in Open Source software. Their ambition, innovation and ideas have made this important milestone possible! The entire Seam community should recognize and appreciate them for their dedication to the project, which is very much a collective community effort.  While there are too many names to mention individually in this post, the full list of Seam contributors can be found <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/seam/3/latest/reference/en-US/html/seam.credits.html#d0e10" target="" class="regularLink">here</a>.
