Just two weeks after 5.3.2.Final, here is a new maintenance release for the 5.3 branch, namely Hibernate ORM 5.3.3.Final.

No big changes but a lot of bugfixes and tweaks (keep the test cases coming!).

The big news is that we can now run our tests with the latest build of the upcoming JDK 11.

This is a recommended upgrade for everyone using Hibernate ORM 5.3.x.

== What's new

=== Bug fixes

We fixed quite a lot of issues. Some are present in 5.2, so you should think about upgrading to 5.3.

Here is a quick selection of fixes:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12740[HHH-12740] - Subselect fetching doesn't work when multiLoad was used
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12776[HHH-12776] - `NullPointerException` when executing native query on an Audited Entity
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12718[HHH-12718] - Entity changes in `@PreUpdate` callback are not persisted when lazy loading is active for more than one field
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12786[HHH-12786] - Deleting an entity leads to `NullPointerException` in ByteBuddy proxy
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12795[HHH-12795] - Setting `FlushMode` to manual for a `@NamedQuery` is ignored

=== Dependency upgrade

You should update your dependencies to Javassist and ByteBuddy:

 * Javassist: 3.23.1-GA
 * ByteBuddy: 1.8.13

They were upgraded to versions supporting JDK 11.

=== JDK 11 support

We made quite a lot of build changes to support running our tests with the latest build of JDK 11.

They are now run on our CI on a daily basis so we should be ready when JDK 11 gets released.
