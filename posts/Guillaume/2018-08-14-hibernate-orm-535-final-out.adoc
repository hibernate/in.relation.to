Today, we released a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 5.3.

It will be the version included in WildFly 14.

== What's new

=== Bug fixes

This release mostly contains bugfixes:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12875[HHH-12875] and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12882[HHH-12882] - Various fixes regarding `@Where` support
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12871[HHH-12871] - Metamodel contains managed types related to dynamic-map entities that have been excluded
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12905[HHH-12905] - Passing null as parameter is not allowed even when enablePassingNulls() has been called
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12906[HHH-12906] - Statistics.getCollectionRoleNames() reports incorrect value
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12907[HHH-12907] - Avoid garbage collection pressure when creating proxies with ByteBuddy

=== Naive limit handler for Sybase

We implemented a naive limit handler for Sybase: it will only be triggered for traditional `SELECT` and `SELECT DISTINCT` queries and will add a `TOP` clause to these queries.

While simple, it should be useful in a lot of common scenarios.

=== Dependency upgrade

You should update your ByteBuddy dependency to 1.8.17 if you define it manually.
