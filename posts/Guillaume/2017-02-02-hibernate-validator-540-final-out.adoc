It's with great pleasure that I announce you the final release of Hibernate Validator 5.4.0. 

== What's new since 5.4.0.CR1

For those of you following closely this blog, not much to say since 5.4.0.CR1. We fixed a few bugs and polished a few things.

We shod in a small new feature: you can now require a `@ScriptAssert` constraint violation to be reported on a specific field. In the following example, the constraint violation will be reported on the `endDate` property rather than at the class level:

```java
@ScriptAssert(lang = "javascript", script = "_this.endDate.after(_this.startDate)", reportOn="endDate")
public class CalendarEvent {

 	private Date startDate;
 	private Date endDate;

	//...
}
```

You can find the complete list of all addressed issues in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/5.4.0.Final/changelog.txt[change log].

== New documentation layout

We converted the Hibernate Validator documentation to http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] a loooong time ago but we were still using a Docbook output to be able to generate the PDF documentation. AsciiDoctor now has a https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[(still in alpha but already pretty mature) PDF plugin] and we decided to take the final step and get rid of our Docbook output.

So our https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/[reference documentation] is now using a nice AsciiDoctor output and so does our https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/pdf/hibernate_validator_reference.pdf[PDF documentation].

We hope you'll like it. We do!

== 5.4.0 Retrospective

You might not follow our blog on a regular basis so here is a retrospective of all the good things included in 5.4.0.Final.

=== JavaMoney support

Hibernate Validator now includes http://javamoney.github.io/[JavaMoney (JSR 354)] support. You can use `@DecimalMin` and `@DecimalMax` constraints on your `MonetaryAmount` fields and we also introduced a new `@Currency` annotation allowing you to constrain the currency used in your ``MonetaryAmount``s.

See our previous blog posts for more information:

 * http://in.relation.to/2016/12/08/hibernate-validator-540-beta1-and-534-final-out/[5.4.0.Beta1 release announcement]
 * http://in.relation.to/2017/01/12/hibernate-validator-540-cr1-final-out/[5.4.0.CR1 release announcement]

This feature was initially contributed by Lukas Niemeier and Willi Sch√∂nborn from Zalando.

=== Annotation processor improvements

A special thank you goes to https://github.com/marko-bekhta[Marko Bekhta] for his work on the annotation processor. Marko invested a lot of time to get the annotation processor in a par with the latest Hibernate Validator features. Go validate your constraint definitions!

=== WildFly patch

Using WildFly and wanting to use the good things of this new version? We now provide a WildFly patch you can apply on top of your WildFly installation to use 5.4.0.Final.

You can find more information in the http://in.relation.to/2016/12/08/hibernate-validator-540-beta1-and-534-final-out/#applying-a-wildfly-patch[5.4.0.Beta1 release announcement].

=== And a whole lot of good things

 * Improvements to the `@Email` constraints
 * New constraints specific to Polish identification numbers
 * A Ukrainian translation
