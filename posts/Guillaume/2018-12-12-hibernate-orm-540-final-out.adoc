We just released the final version of Hibernate ORM 5.4.0.

It is designed to be a drop in replacement for ORM 5.3.x.

Apart from some changes to entity graphs to make them more user friendly, it's all about bugfixes and polishing.

=== Bugfixes and documentation improvements

We fixed a couple of bugs and regressions and improved the documentation.
