Following the "release early, release often" motto, here comes a new version of Hibernate Validator, 6.0.9.Final.

It brings some nice improvements and fixes a couple of bugs.

This is a recommended upgrade for everyone using Hibernate Validator and it is a drop-in replacement of 6.0.8.Final, except if you already started to use the new constraint validator payload feature (see below).

== What's new

=== Performance improvements

We made a couple of further performance tweaks in this release, making Hibernate Validator faster for common use cases.

You can check the results in http://in.relation.to/2018/03/20/bean-validation-benchmark-rerevisited/[this blog post] we published a week ago.

=== Constraint validator payload changes

This feature is still incubating and https://github.com/mkurz[Matthias Kurz] made some changes to fix a caching issue and change how the payload was passed to the constraint validator.

The payload is now part of the `HibernateConstraintValidatorContext` instead of the `HibernateConstraintValidatorInitializationContext`, meaning it is now designed to be used in the `isValid()` method rather than the `init()` method.

Check https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#constraint-validator-payload[our updated documentation] for more information.

=== Karaf features improvements

Our Karaf features are now split in several smaller features:

* `hibernate-validator`
* `hibernate-validator-jsoup`
* `hibernate-validator-joda-time`
* `hibernate-validator-javax-money`
* `hibernate-validator-groovy`
* `hibernate-validator-paranamer`

The dependencies are more fined grained and you can pick exactly what you need.

We plan to propose an upgrade of Hibernate Validator in Karaf very soon. In the meantime, you can use the http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hibernate/validator/hibernate-validator-osgi-karaf-features/6.0.9.Final/hibernate-validator-osgi-karaf-features-6.0.9.Final-features.xml[features file we publish to Maven Central].

=== Bugs fixed

We also fixed a couple of bugs:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1596[HV-1596] - This one is a regression we had since the start of the 6.0.x cycle. It could cause ``NullPointerException``s when building the metadata of beans using cascading on properties with specific class hierarchies.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1594[HV-1594] - A dependency was missing in our Karaf features, making it impossible to install Hibernate Validator on some Karaf environments.

=== Full changelog

The complete list of fixed issues can be found https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20HV%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20{released-version}%20order%20by%20created%20DESC[on our JIRA].

== Getting {released-version}

To get the release with Maven, Gradle etc. use the GAV coordinates _org.hibernate.validator:{hibernate-validator|hibernate-validator-cdi|hibernate-validator-annotation-processor}:{released-version}_. Note that the group id has changed from `org.hibernate` (Hibernate Validator 5 and earlier) to `org.hibernate.validator` (from Hibernate Validator 6 onwards).

Alternatively, a distribution bundle containing all the bits is provided on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-{released-version}-dist.tar.gz/download[TAR.GZ], http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-{released-version}-dist.zip/download[ZIP]).

If you want to benefit from the new features of this version on WildFly, we also provide WildFly patches for http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hibernate/validator/hibernate-validator-modules/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-modules-{released-version}-wildfly-11.0.0.Final-patch.zip[WildFly 11] and http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hibernate/validator/hibernate-validator-modules/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-modules-{released-version}-wildfly-12.0.0.Final-patch.zip[WildFly 12]. You can read about how to apply such patches https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#_updating_hibernate_validator_in_wildfly[here].

== What's next?

Our efforts are now directed towards the new 6.1, which will introduce some structuring new features.

We plan to publish a ultimate 6.0.x release in the light of changes we made to the Bean Validation TCK.

We updated http://hibernate.org/validator/roadmap/[our roadmap] with the ideas we have for the future. If you want to join us, don't hesitate to pick a task and come discuss it with us.
