Last week I recorded a couple of podcasts. The <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/java-contexts-dependency-injection" target="" class="regularLink">first one</a>, with Nitin from DZone, gives a good overview of where we are going with Web Beans and Seam 3 - we talk about what JCDI is, how it fits into Seam 3, and the migration path.

A couple of days later, I talked to <a href="http://techcast.chariotsolutions.com/index.php?post_id=478352#" target="" class="regularLink">Ken from Chariot Tech Cast</a>; we got into a lot of depth on JCDI and did an extensive tour of it's features - a good companion to the <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/JCDI+-+JSR299" target="" class="regularLink">JCDI webinar</a> I'm recording later today!</p>
