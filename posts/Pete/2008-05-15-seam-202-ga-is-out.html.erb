<p class="wikiPara">
I'm pleased to say we have released Seam 2.0.2.GA.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
This release focuses on stability, component updates and documentation improvements. We've fixed over 150 bugs since Seam 2 was released back in November, and, with over 70 000 downloads since then, Seam 2 has had pretty good exposure.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Thanks to the hard work of the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/jbossORG.html" target="" class="regularLink">JBoss.org team</a> we've also improved the look and feel of the reference documentation.  Technical content has also been added with chapters on <a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.0.2.GA/reference/en-US/html/gettingstartedwithjbosstools.html" target="" class="regularLink">getting started</a> with <a href="http://jboss.org/tools" target="" class="regularLink">JBoss Tools</a>, <a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.0.2.GA/reference/en-US/html/i18n.html#d0e8998" target="" class="regularLink">a tutorial on internationalising your app</a>, and updated information on using Seam with different application containers.
