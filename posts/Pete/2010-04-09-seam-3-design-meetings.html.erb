Following on from the success of the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-13462" target="" class="regularLink">RichFaces Design Meetings</a> held weekly on IRC, we're going to do the same for Seam 3. We'll be holding a regular 45 minute meeting every <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&amp;month=4&amp;year=2010&amp;hour=14&amp;min=45&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=90" target="" class="regularLink">Thursday at 13:45</a> in <tt>#seam-dev</tt> on <a href="http://freenode.net" target="" class="regularLink">irc.freenode.net</a>. At this meeting we will cover a mix of technical architecture and project planning - if you are interested in working on a Seam module, or just want to know more about the progress of Seam 3, this is a good opportunity to drop by!

<p>I'm also back recently from an extended holiday to Nepal, which is a good enough excuse for me to include a photo of the high point of the trip (and at 5500m of my life!).</p>
