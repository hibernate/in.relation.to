<p class="wikiPara">
I'm pleased to announce that the Web Beans project has a new name -- <b>Weld</b>
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
As keen readers of <a href="http://in.relation.to" target="" class="regularLink">in.relation.to</a> will know, this is just the latest in a series of <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/RevisedPublicDraftOfJSR299JavaContextsAndDependencyInjection#H-TerminologyAndNameChanges" target="" class="regularLink">name</a> <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/JSR299PublicReviewDraftApprovedByEC" target="" class="regularLink">changes</a> for <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299" target="" class="regularLink">JSR-299</a>. This time around, one of the Java EE vendors had strong objections to the previous name of the reference implementation, and asked us to change it.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
After consulting with the committers on the project (those employed by Red Hat, and those in the community), we decided on Weld.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We'll be updating the project (artifact names, package names, documentation, website, JIRA, SVN etc.) over the next week in time for our release which is feature-complete to the Proposed Final Draft 2 (PFD2) of the JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection Specification. We'll send regular updates to the <a href="https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/webbeans-dev" target="" class="regularLink">webbeans-dev</a> mailing list (which of course, will need a rename!).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
I'll blog again once the rename is done with new URLs, mailing list addresses etc.</p>
