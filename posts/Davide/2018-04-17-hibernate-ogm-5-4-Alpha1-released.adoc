We're happy to announce the release of http://hibernate.org/ogm/releases/5.4/#get-it[Hibernate OGM 5.4.0.Alpha1].

Hibernate OGM is now compatible with Hibernate ORM 5.3 (still a candidate release)
and JPA 2.2. We support Infinipan 9.2 and
JBoss modules are now available as https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-build-tools[WildFly
feature packs].

You can run server-side JavaScript on MongoDB or Java code in Infinispan Embedded as if they
were stored procedures
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.4/reference/en-US/html_single/#_using_stored_procedures[using
the JPA approach].

When using the Infinispan Remote dialect it is now possible to
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.4/reference/en-US/html_single/#_caches_creation_and_configuration[configure
new caches] using the `@CacheConfiguration` annotation.

All the changes are described in detail in the
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10160&version=31632[release notes].

== What happened to the JBoss modules?

The Hibernate OGM JBoss Modules, for use in WildFly or JBoss EAP, are now distributed as
WildFly feature packs. The feature packs can also be consumed using
http://wildfly-swarm.io/[WildFly Swarm].

This means that from version 5.4 of Hibernate OGM you won't find anymore the zip file
containing them on SourceForge.

The modules are now distributed as multiple feature packs,
which means that components are split in fine grained packages,
allowing you to pick only the parts you will need.

https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.4/reference/en-US/html_single/#_packaging_hibernate_ogm_applications_for_wildfly_12_0[See the documentation]
for more information on the available feature packs and how to consume them.

You can also find a quick-start 
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm/tree/master/documentation/examples/wildfly-quickstart[on the Hibernate OGM repository on GitHub].

== JavaScript code as stored procedures in MongoDB

Here's an example of how you can register a server-side function (`findByBrandJS` in this
example) as a stored procedure and call it:

====
----
@Entity
@NamedStoredProcedureQueries({
        @NamedStoredProcedureQuery(name = "find_cars_by_brand", procedureName = "findByBrandJS", parameters = {
                @StoredProcedureParameter(mode = ParameterMode.REF_CURSOR, type = Void.class),
                @StoredProcedureParameter(mode = ParameterMode.IN, type = String.class)
        }, resultSetMappings = "carMapping")
})
@SqlResultSetMapping(name = "carMapping", entities = { @EntityResult(entityClass = Car.class) })
public class Car {
  ...
}
----

----
javax.persistence.EntityManager em = ...

StoredProcedureQuery storedProcedureQuery = em.createNamedStoredProcedureQuery( "find_cars_by_brand" );
storedProcedureQuery.setParameter( 1, "Bentley" );
List<Car> cars = storedProcedureQuery.getResultList();
----
====

Note that this is JPA code and it will work for all the dialects supporting stored procedures and
positional parameters.

== Apache Ignite dialect for Hibernate OGM 5.3.1.Final

We also released a new dialect for Hibernate OGM 5.3.1.Final and https://ignite.apache.org/[Apache Ignite]:
Hibernate OGM Apache Ignite 5.3.1.Final

You can include the dialect in your project using the maven coordinates:

* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-ignite:5.3.1.Final_

The source code is on GitHub: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-ignite

This dialect has been developed by the community and it is still experimental.
Please, let us know what you think about it.
