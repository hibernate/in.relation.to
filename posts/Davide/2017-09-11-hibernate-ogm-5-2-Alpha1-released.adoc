I'm happy to announce the latest release of Hibernate OGM:
http://hibernate.org/ogm/[Hibernate OGM] 5.2 Alpha1

The first thing you will notice in this release is that several dialects are not part
of the core project anymore. We decided to focus our work on the http://infinispan.org[Infinispan],
https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] and https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB] dialects.

Highlights of the release:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1294[Fixed bugs related to polymorphic hierarchies]
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1290[Improved query performance in Neo4j]
* Infinispan Remote dialect via Hot Rod now
  https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1285[supports operation grouping]
* Support https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1246[map-reduce] and
  https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1247[distinct] operations in MongoDB
  using the MongoDB CLI query language
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1282[Removed the Fongo dialect]

If you need to upgrade from a version before 5.2, you can find help on the
https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateOGMMigrationNotes[migration notes].

All the changes are described in the
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10160&version=28001[release notes].

== What happened to the CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra and Ehcache dialects?

They have now their own repository:

* https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-cassandra[Cassandra dialect]
* https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-couchdb[CouchDB dialect]
* https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-ehcache[Ehcache dialect]
* https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-redis[Redis dialect]

Keeping too many dialects aligned in term of features and releases is starting to impact the speed
of our development. We decided to focus our attention on the most popular dialects and, at the same
time, give contributors the freedom to manage the dialect without having to wait for us.

From now on, a new dialect will spend some time in its own repository and it will be included
in the core project only if we consider it mature enough and, ideally, if somebody volunteers
to maintain it regularly.

This also means that in the future we might not release all these dialects for each
`hibernate-ogm-core` release.

Feel free to contact us if you have more questions about this.

== Where can I get it?

You can get the required core library using the following Maven coordinates:

* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-core:5.2.0.Alpha1_ 

and these are the backends currently available for 5.2.0.Alpha1:

* http://cassandra.apache.org[Cassandra]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-cassandra:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* http://couchdb.apache.org[CouchDB]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-couchdb:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* http://infinispan.org[Infinispan] 
** Embedded: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan:5.2.0.Alpha1_
** Remote: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan-remote:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* http://www.ehcache.org[Ehcache]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-ehcache:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-mongodb:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* http://neo4j.com[Neo4j]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-neo4j:5.2.0.Alpha1_
* http://redis.io[Redis]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-redis:5.2.0.Alpha1_

Alternatively, you can download archives containing all the binaries, source code and documentation
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-ogm/5.2.0.Alpha1[from Sourceforge].

== What's next?

Our work will focus mainly on the Infinispan Remote dialect and the upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.2.

== Special thanks

I would like to thanks some contributors that helped us adding new features and fix some unexpected
behaviours:

* https://github.com/hholierhoek[Hubert Holierhoek] for finding ways to make the queries on Neo4j faster
* https://github.com/raghav-jha[Raghav Jha] thanks to him MongoDB native queries now support
  Map-Reduce and distinct operations
* https://github.com/schernolyas[Sergey Chernolyas] for helping with the MongoDB dialect and the work
  on the OrientDB and Apache Ignite dialects (coming soon)
* Dimitrij Drus for helping us finding some problems with polymorphic hierarchies (now fixed)
