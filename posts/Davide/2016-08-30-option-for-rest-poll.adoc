http://hibernate.org/ogm/[Hibernate OGM] has been able for a while to work with an
embedded https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] instance.
In the next release, we want to add the ability to connect to a remote Neo4j server.

A new binary protocol is available since Neo4j 3 to connect to a remote server:
https://dzone.com/articles/introducing-bolt-neo4js-upcoming-binary-protocol-p[Bolt].

In addition to Bolt, Neo4j comes also with a RESTful API and we are wondering if we should
add an option to switch between the two approaches.

To sum up, given the option, would you choose the RESTful API instead of Bolt to connect
to Neo4j using Hibernate OGM?

We created a poll on the https://twitter.com/Hibernate[Hibernate twitter account] where
https://twitter.com/Hibernate/status/770553178349768706[you can vote your preference].

This is the right time to let us know what you think.
