For the first Hibernate OGM release of the year, I'm happy to announce
http://hibernate.org/ogm/releases/5.2/#get-it[Hibernate OGM 5.2 CR1].

This will become the next 5.2 Final soon and we added support for Geospatial integration
and new native operator support with https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB],
https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] queries performance improvements and
integration with cluster counters for http://infinispan.org[Infinispan] embedded.

If you need to upgrade from a version before 5.2, you can find help on the
https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateOGMMigrationNotes[migration notes].

All the changes are described in the
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10160&version=31605[release notes].

== Infinispan embedded sequences and id generation

When using the Infinispan embedded dialect, Hibernate OGM will now exploit clustered counters
for id generation and sequences. If you are not familiar with them you can find more details in
the http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#clustered_counters[Infinispan documentation]

At the moment, Infinispan only support counters for clustered caches, for this reason,
Hibernate OGM won't be able to generate id or sequences if you are using local caches.
The Infinispan team is working on this and we are going to fix it as soon as possible.
Keep an eye on issue https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1376[OGM-1376]
if you want to be up-to-date.

We also changed the name of the artifact, the artifact to be included in the POM is now the
following:

====
[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.ogm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-ogm-infinispan-embedded</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.0.CR1</version>
</dependency>

== Neo4j performance

Thanks to feedback from Klaas Dellschaft, we found out we were doing inefficient
queries when loading entities from Neo4j. Issue
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM-1344[OGM-1344] contains more information.

== MongoDB geospatial and native API 

Hibernate OGM now supports the ability to declare geospatial fields by using specific Java types
that will be automatically converted to GeoJSON objects stored in MongoDB.
Here's an example:

====
[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(indexes = {
        @Index(columnList = "location", name = "location_spatial_idx")
})
@IndexOptions(
        @IndexOption(forIndex = "location_spatial_idx", options = "{ _type: '2dsphere' }")
)
public class Restaurant {

    // [...]

    GeoPoint location;
}
----
====

More details in the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#_geospatial_support[Hibernate OGM documentation].

We also improved the MongoDB native CLI API with the addition of new operations:
replaceOne, updateMany, updateOne, deleteMany, deleteOne, insertMany, insertOne.

Here's an example of a native query:

====
[source,java]
----
String nativeQuery = "db.Poem.remove({ '_id': { '$numberLong': '11' } })";
session.createNativeQuery( nativeQuery ).executeUpdate();
----

== Where can I get it?

You can include in your project the dialect of your choice using this maven coordinates:

* http://infinispan.org[Infinispan] 
** Embedded: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan-embedded:5.2.0.CR1_
** Remote: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan-remote:5.2.0.CR1_
* https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-mongodb:5.2.0.CR1_
