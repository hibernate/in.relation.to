== How can I get it?

All details are available on the

If you are new to Hibernate Reactive, {getting-started}[the official documentation] is a good place to start.

== Microsoft SQL Server

You can use now Hibernate Reactive with Microsoft SQL Server. Like for the other databases, you will have
to add the following dependencies to your project (using GAV coordinates):

```
org.hibernate.reactive:hibernate-reactive-core:1.0.0.CR9
io.vertx:vertx-mssql-client:4.1.2
```

And here an example of a URL to use in the configuration:
```
hibernate.connection.url = sqlserver://localhost:1433
```

Check the documentation for a http://hibernate.org/reactive/documentation/1.0/reference/html_single/#_basic_configuration[list of available configuration properties].
