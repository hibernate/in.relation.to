Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

Merging entities is fairly easy since you can use the `merge` provided by the `EntityManager` or the Hibernate `Session`. However, merging collections requires more consideration, as explained by
https://vladmihalcea.com/merge-entity-collections-jpa-hibernate/[this article].

If you are using Kotlin and want to use JPA and Hibernate for you data access layer,
https://dzone.com/articles/kotlin-data-classes-and-jpa[this article]
explains how to implement the `equals()`,  `hashCode()`, `copy()`, and `toString()` methods.

https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-field-naming-spring-boot[This article]
shows you how to use a custom Hibernate naming strategy when using Spring Boot.

Every entity query, be it JPQL or Criteria API, needs to be parsed and compiled to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) in order to generate the associated SQL query. The entity query compilation takes time, as explained in
https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-query-plan-cache/[this article]
so Hibernate provides a `QueryPlanCache` to store already-compiled plans.

Starting with Hibernate 5.4, the Hibernate `Statistics` object allows you to monitor the Query Plan Cache, and
https://vladmihalcea.com/optimize-jpql-criteria-api-query-plans-hibernate-statistics/[this article]
shows you how to take advantage of this feature to speed up IN query performance.
