On Baeldung, you can find a very good article about http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-pagination[JPA and Hibernate pagination].
While JPA 2.2 defines support for Java 1.8 Stream operations.
https://vladmihalcea.com/whats-new-in-jpa-2-2-stream-the-result-of-a-query-execut[pagination is still the proffered way to controlling the amount of data being fetched].

Have you ever wondered how you can map a JPA many-to-many association with extra column?
If you are interested in the best way to much a a relationship,
then you should definitely read
https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-many-to-many-association-with-extra-columns-when-using-jpa-and-hibernate/[this article].

If you're using a relational database, then you should be using a connection pool as well.
Check out
https://beansroasted.wordpress.com/2017/07/29/connection-pool-analysis/[this article]
for an performance analysis of the most common Java connection pools.
You will also need connection pool monitoring, and the
https://github.com/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool[FlexyPool] open source framework allows you to do so.

Hibernate offers a dirty checking mechanism which https://vladmihalcea.com/the-anatomy-of-hibernate-dirty-checking/[automatically detects changes to managed entities].
While the default mechanism is suitable for most use cases, you can even customize it as explained in
http://in.relation.to/2013/04/10/options-for-entity-dirtness-checking/[this article].

If you ever wondered why you got the _HHH000179: Narrowing proxy to class this operation breaks ==_ warning message or
wondered how to fix it, then you should read

Traditionally, storing EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) data in a RDBMS has required various tricks to handle multiple value types.
Now that most relational databases support JSON column types,
you can use a custom Hibernate type to store your EAV data as a `JsonNode` object.
Check out
https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-store-schema-less-eav-entity-attribute-value-data-using-json-and-hibernate/[this article]
for a step-by-step tutorial that will show you how you can accomplish this task.

https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-08-01-practical-guide-sql-isolation.html[a great article]
about the difference between various SQL isolation levels with examples for various phenomena like read skew, write skew or lost updates.
