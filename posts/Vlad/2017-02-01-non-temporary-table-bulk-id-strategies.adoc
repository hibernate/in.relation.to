This article is about the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11262[HHH-11262] JIRA issue which now allows the bulk-id
strategies to work even when you cannot create temporary tables.

== Class diagram

Considering we have the following entities:

image::NonTempTableEntityClassDiagram.png["Class diagram, align="center", width="400"]

The `Person` entity is the base class of this entity inheritance model, and is mapped as follows:

[source,java]
----
Entity(name = "Person")
@Inheritance(
    strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED
)
public class Person
    implements Serializable {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    @Id
    private String companyName;

    private String name;

    private boolean employed;

    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if ( this == o ) {
            return true;
        }
        if ( !( o instanceof Person ) ) {
            return false;
        }
        Person person = (Person) o;
        return Objects.equals(
            getId(),
            person.getId()
        ) &&
        Objects.equals(
            getCompanyName(),
            person.getCompanyName()
        );
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(
            getId(), getCompanyName()
        );
    }
}
----

Both the `Doctor` and `Engineer` entity classes extend the `Person` base class:

[source,java]
----
@Entity(name = "Doctor")
public class Doctor
    extends Person {
}

@Entity(name = "Engineer")
public class Engineer
    extends Person {

    private boolean fellow;

    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
----

== Inheritance tree bulk processing

Now, when you try to execute a bulk entity query:

[source,java]
----
int updateCount = session.createQuery(
    "delete from Person where employed = :employed" )
.setParameter( "employed", false )
.executeUpdate();
----

Hibernate executes the following statements:

[source,sql]
----
create temporary table
    HT_Person
(
    id int4 not null,
    companyName varchar(255) not null
)

insert
into
    HT_Person
    select
        p.id as id,
        p.companyName as companyName
    from
        Person p
    where
        p.employed = ?

delete
from
    Engineer
where
    (
        id, companyName
    ) IN (
        select
            id,
            companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )

delete
from
    Doctor
where
    (
        id, companyName
    ) IN (
        select
            id,
            companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )

delete
from
    Person
where
    (
        id, companyName
    ) IN (
        select
            id,
            companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )
----

`HT_Person` is a temporary table that Hibernate creates to hold all the entity identifiers that are to be updated or deleted by the bulk id operation.
The temporary table can be either global or local, depending on the underlying database capabilities.

== What if you cannot create a temporary table?

As the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11262[HHH-11262] issue describes, there are use cases when the application developer cannot use temporary tables because
the database user lacks this privilege.

In this case, we defined several options which you can choose depending on your database capabilities:

- `InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy`
- `InlineIdsSubSelectValueListBulkIdStrategy`
- `InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy`
- `CteValuesListBulkIdStrategy`

=== `InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy`

To use this strategy, you need to configure the following configuration property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.hql.bulk_id_strategy"
          value="org.hibernate.hql.spi.id.inline.InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy"
/>
----

Now, when running the previous test case, Hibernate generates the following SQL statements:

[source,sql]
----
select
    p.id as id,
    p.companyName as companyName
from
    Person p
where
    p.employed = ?

delete
from
    Engineer
where
        ( id, companyName )
    in (
        ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
    )

delete
from
    Doctor
where
        ( id, companyName )
    in (
        ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
    )

delete
from
    Person
where
        ( id, companyName )
    in (
        ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
        ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
        ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
    )
----

So, the entity identifiers are selected first and used for each particular update or delete statement.

[TIP]
====
The IN clause row value expression has long been supported by Oracle, PostgreSQL, and nowadays by MySQL 5.7.
However, SQL Server 2014 does not support this syntax, so you'll have to use a different strategy.
====

=== `InlineIdsSubSelectValueListBulkIdStrategy`

To use this strategy, you need to configure the following configuration property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.hql.bulk_id_strategy"
          value="org.hibernate.hql.spi.id.inline.InlineIdsSubSelectValueListBulkIdStrategy"
/>
----

Now, when running the previous test case, Hibernate generates the following SQL statements:

[source,sql]
----
select
    p.id as id,
    p.companyName as companyName
from
    Person p
where
    p.employed = ?

delete
from
    Engineer
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
        select
            id,
            companyName
        from (
        values
            ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
        ) as HT
            (id, companyName)
    )

delete
from
    Doctor
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
         select
            id,
            companyName
        from (
        values
            ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
        ) as HT
            (id, companyName)
    )

delete
from
    Person
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
        select
            id,
            companyName
        from (
        values
            ( 1,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat USA' ),
            ( 1,'Red Hat Europe' ),
            ( 3,'Red Hat Europe' )
        ) as HT
            (id, companyName)
    )
----

[TIP]
====
The underlying database must support the VALUES list clause, like PostgreSQL or SQL Server 2008.
However, this strategy requires the IN-clause row value expression for composite identifiers so you can use this strategy only with PostgreSQL.
====

=== `InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy`

To use this strategy, you need to configure the following configuration property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.hql.bulk_id_strategy"
          value="org.hibernate.hql.spi.id.inline.InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy"
/>
----

Now, when running the previous test case, Hibernate generates the following SQL statements:

[source,sql]
----
select
    p.id as id,
    p.companyName as companyName
from
    Person p
where
    p.employed = ?

delete
from
    Engineer
where
    ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )

delete
from
    Doctor
where
    ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )

delete
from
    Person
where
    ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat USA' )
or  ( id = 1 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )
or  ( id = 3 and companyName = 'Red Hat Europe' )
----

[TIP]
====
This strategy has the advantage of being supported by all the major relational database systems (e.g. Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL).
====

=== `CteValuesListBulkIdStrategy`

To use this strategy, you need to configure the following configuration property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.hql.bulk_id_strategy"
          value="org.hibernate.hql.spi.id.inline.CteValuesListBulkIdStrategy"
/>
----

Now, when running the previous test case, Hibernate generates the following SQL statements:

[source,sql]
----
select
    p.id as id,
    p.companyName as companyName
from
    Person p
where
    p.employed = ?

with HT_Person (id,companyName ) as (
    select id, companyName
    from (
    values
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?)
    ) as HT (id, companyName) )
delete
from
    Engineer
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
        select
            id, companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )

with HT_Person (id,companyName ) as (
    select id, companyName
    from (
    values
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?)
    ) as HT (id, companyName) )
delete
from
    Doctor
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
        select
            id, companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )


with HT_Person (id,companyName ) as (
    select id, companyName
    from (
    values
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?),
        (?, ?)
    ) as HT (id, companyName) )
delete
from
    Person
where
    ( id, companyName ) in (
        select
            id, companyName
        from
            HT_Person
    )
----

[TIP]
====
The underlying database must support the CTE (Common Table Expressions) that can be referenced from non-query statements as well, like PostgreSQL since 9.1 or SQL Server since 2005.
The underlying database must also support the VALUES list clause, like PostgreSQL or SQL Server 2008.

However, this strategy requires the IN-clause row value expression for composite identifiers, so you can only use this strategy only with PostgreSQL.
====

== Conclusion

If you can use temporary tables, that's probably the best choice.
However, if you are not allowed to create temporary tables, you must pick one of these four strategies that works with your underlying database.
Before making your mind, you should benchmark which one works best for your current workload.
For instance, http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-ctes-are-optimization-fences/[CTE are optimization fences in PostgreSQL], so make sure you measure before taking a decision.

If you're using Oracle or MySQL 5.7, you can choose either `InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy` or `InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy`.
For older version of MySQL, then you can only use `InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy`.

If you're using SQL Server, `InlineIdsOrClauseBulkIdStrategy` is the only option for you.

If you're using PostgreSQL, then you  have the luxury of choosing any of these four strategies.
