Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Market share

According to the
https://snyk.io/blog/jvm-ecosystem-report-2018-platform-application[2018 JVM ecosystem report published by Snyk],
Hibernate has a 54% market share, making it the most popular Java data access technology.

Although it's been available since 2001, Hibernate has been evolving constantly, and the Hibernate ORM version 6 is going to bring many new features and improvements, so stay tuned!

== Articles

JPA 2.2 supports the following `java.time` types introduced by Java 8:

- `java.time.LocalDate`
- `java.time.LocalTime`
- `java.time.LocalDateTime`
- `java.time.OffsetTime`
- `java.time.OffsetDateTime`

Apart from supporting all those types, Hibernate provides the following extra types:

- `java.time.Duration`
- `java.time.Instant`
- `java.time.ZonedDateTime`

However, neither JPA nor Hibernate support the `java.time.Year` and `java.time.YearMonth` out-of-the-box. The following two articles show you how to support these types when using JPA and Hibernate:

- https://vladmihalcea.com/java-time-year-month-jpa-hibernate/[How to map `java.time.Year` and `java.time.Month` with JPA and Hibernate]
- https://vladmihalcea.com/java-yearmonth-jpa-hibernate/[How to map the Java `YearMonth` type with JPA and Hibernate]

Eugen Paraschiv wrote two articles about Hibernate:
