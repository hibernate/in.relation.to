<p class="wikiPara">
I'm very happy to announce the IronJacamar 1.0.0.CR1 release, which implements the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.6 specification.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Full release notes are <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310691&amp;version=12313377" target="" class="regularLink">here</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-NewTransactionIntegration"><a href="/2011/06/09/iron-jacamar-100-cr-1-is-out#H-NewTransactionIntegration">New transaction integration</a></h2>

<p class="wikiPara">
This release saw a new transaction integration which has allowed us to better isolate the interaction with the transaction manager and its components - like recovery.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
So if you are looking to integrate a JCA container into your project, it has just become a lot easier.
</p>

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-NewLoggingIntegration"><a href="/2011/06/09/iron-jacamar-100-cr-1-is-out#H-NewLoggingIntegration">New logging integration</a></h2>

<p class="wikiPara">
We have switched the project to use the new JBoss Logging framework, which allows us to assign unique identifiers to logging statements and exception messages.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
This integration will ease our quest to identify issues that may pop up when people run their applications.
</p>

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-OtherFeatures"><a href="/2011/06/09/iron-jacamar-100-cr-1-is-out#H-OtherFeatures">Other features</a></h2>

<p class="wikiPara">
The release also saw updated in other areas
</p>

<ul class="wikiUnorderedList">
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Improvements to the code generator</li>
<li class="wikiUnorderedListItem"> Added support non JTA datasources</li>
</ul>

<p class="wikiPara">
along with the various bug fixes.
</p>

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-TheRoadAhead"><a href="/2011/06/09/iron-jacamar-100-cr-1-is-out#H-TheRoadAhead">The Road Ahead</a></h2>

<p class="wikiPara">
Since we have hit the Candidate for Release mark - yay ! - we have created a stable release branch, since this release could be promoted to 1.0.0.Final if no serious issues are found within the next two weeks.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We will work on improving the documentation around areas that could use some - but we don't expect any major changes from this point on.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Our trunk have been switched to 1.1 development - we expect to see the first developer snapshot in August. But more on that later :) However, I will say that there are a lot of exciting things ahead !
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
So people, test and report any bugs that you may find, as it is almost time for champagne !
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
For Those About to Rock, We Salute You !
