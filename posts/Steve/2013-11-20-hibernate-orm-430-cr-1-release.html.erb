<p class="wikiPara">
The Hibernate team is proud to announce the 4.3.0.CR1 release of Hibernate ORM.  This is the first release candidate for 4.3 and JPA 2.1 support.  For those who maybe are not familiar with our release methodology, this means that in 2-3 weeks this release will essentially be re-tagged as Final unless some critical bugs are reported with it in the meantime.
