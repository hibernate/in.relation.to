The 5th bug-fix release for Hibernate ORM 5.0 has just been http://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases/tag/5.0.5[tagged] and published.  This release and the upcoming 5.0.6 release have been done on an accelerated timebox of 2 weeks (from the normal 4 weeks for bugfix releases) due to US holidays.

The complete list of changes can be found http://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/21750[here] (or https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10031&version=21850[here] for people without a Hibernate Jira account).
