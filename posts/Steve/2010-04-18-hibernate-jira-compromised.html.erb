<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/" target="" class="regularLink">Atlassian</a> and <a href="http://www.contegix.com/" target="" class="regularLink">Contegix</a> (who together make the Hibernate JIRA possible) have found evidence that the <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate" target="" class="regularLink">Hibernate JIRA</a> has been compromised through the recent JIRA <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Security+Advisory+2010-04-16" target="" class="regularLink">exploit</a> affecting numerous Open Source JIRA instances.  
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
At this time they are still investigating and analyzing to determine the extent of the compromise.  Specifically it is unknown yet whether passwords or user data in general were accessed.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
In the meantime, Contegix will be upgrading the JIRA software.  As a protection measure, all passwords have been reset.  On logging back in you will be forced to reset your password via email (look for the <q>Can't access your account?</q> link next to the Log In button).</p>
