<p class="wikiPara">
The second release candidate for Hibernate ORM 4.3.0 is just released.  There were a few issues with CR1 that required a second CR, especially <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8739" target="" class="regularLink">HHH-8739</a> and <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8759" target="" class="regularLink">HHH-8759</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The full change log for the release can be seen at https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH/fixforversion/15150.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
In 2 weeks we'll decide whether a CR3 is needed or release Final at that time.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Thanks for all the feedback!</p>
