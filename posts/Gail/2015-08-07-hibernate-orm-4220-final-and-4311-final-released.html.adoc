Hibernate ORM 4.2.20.Final was released 24-July-2015. At the time it was released,
SourceForge was out of commission so distributions could not be uploaded. I decided
to delay the announcement until SourceForge was back in commission and I was able
to release 4.3.11.Final on 5-Aug-2015.

== Notable bugfixes

In both 4.3.11.Final and 4.2.20.Final:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-2851[HHH-2851] fixed a longstanding bug
affecting dialects that require the type for binding null parameter values to a query
predicate like (`:param IS NULL OR alias.someField = :param`). This bug affected Oracle
and SQL Server dialects, and possibly others. This bug was easily worked around, but
it was clearly a headache for people using those dialects.

In 4.3.11.Final only:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9287[HHH-9287] fixed a bug that caused
pooled optimizer identifiers to be reused if an external (to Hibernate) system inserted
a row using the same sequence.

* Hibernate's support for AttributeConverter was improved. https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8804[HHH-8804]
adds support for a parameterized type as an AttributeConverter type parameter
(e.g., `AttributeConverter<Set<Category>, String>`);
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8854[HHH-8854] fixed a bug extracting
the ParameterizedType representation of AttributeConverter definition from an
implementation that did not directly implement AttributeConverter
i.e., a superclass implements AttributeConverter.

* There were some bugfixes related to lazy (byte-code instrumented) properties.
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-5255[HHH-5255] fixed a longstanding
bug merging a detached entity with a lazy property that has been initialized
(this only works for "property" access);
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-7573[HHH-7573] fixed a bug processing
lazy properties after an EntityManager PreUpdate callback;
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9629[HHH-9629] fixed a bug in cache
key generation for an entity with inheritance when fetching lazy property.
