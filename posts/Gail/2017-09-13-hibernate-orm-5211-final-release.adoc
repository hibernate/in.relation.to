== Changes to how Clob values are processed using PostgreSQL81Dialect and its subclasses

A breaking change was made in how Clob values are processed using PostgreSQL81Dialect and its subclasses. The following is copied from the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/5.2.11/migration-guide.adoc#changes-to-how-clob-values-are-processed-using-postgresql81dialect-and-its-subclasses[migration guide].

Up to and including 5.2.8, `Clob` values and values for `String`, `character[]`, and `Character[]` attributes that are
annotated with `@Lob` were:

* bound using `Clob` representations of the data (using `PreparedStatement#setClob` or `CallableStatement#setClob`);
* retrieved as `Clob` values (using `ResultSet#getClob` or `CallableStatement#getClob`), which were converted to the
appropriate Java type;
* stored as PostgreSQL Large Objects; i.e., an `OID` for the value is stored in a `text` column,
 which refers to the actual data stored in a different (PostgreSQL-specific) table.

In 5.2.9 and 5.2.10, due to the fix for https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11477[HHH-11477], `Clob` values and values for `String`, `character[]`, and `Character[]`
attributes that are annotated with `@Lob` were:

* bound using `String` representations of the data (using `PreparedStatement#setString` or `CallableStatement#setString`);
* retrieved as `String` values (using `ResultSet#getString` or `CallableStatement#getString`), which were converted
to the appropriate Java type;
* stored as variable-length character strings.

In 5.2.11, the fix for https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11477[HHH-11477] was reverted
(https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11614[HHH-11614]) to restore the 5.2.8 behavior.

As a consequence of these changes, data persisted using a version of Hibernate prior to 5.2.9 cannot be read
using 5.2.9 or 5.2.10. Data persisted using Hibernate 5.2.9 or 5.2.10 can no longer be read using 5.2.11 or later.

A workaround that can be used in 5.2.9 and 5.2.10 that will restore the 5.2.8/5.2.11 behavior is to override the
PostgreSQL dialect with:

[source,java]
----
public SqlTypeDescriptor getSqlTypeDescriptorOverride(int sqlCode) {
	if( sqlCode == Types.CLOB ){
		return ClobTypeDescriptor.CLOB_BINDING;
	}
	return super.getSqlTypeDescriptorOverride( sqlCode );
}
----

In addition, any `Clob` values and values for `String`, `character[]`, `Character[]` attributes that are annotated with
`@Lob` that were stored as variable-length character strings using 5.2.9 or 5.2.10 should be updated to store the values
as PostgreSQL Large Objects before migrating to 5.2.11.

For example, if variable-length character strings were stored by 5.2.9 or 5.2.10 for the following mapping:

[source,java]
----
@Entity(name = "TestEntity")
@Table(name = "TEST_ENTITY")
public static class TestEntity {
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private long id;

	@Lob
	String firstLobField;

	@Lob
	String secondLobField;

	@Lob
	Clob clobField;

	...
}
----

the variable-length character strings can be converted to PostgreSQL Large Objects by executing the following SQL:

[source,sql]
----
update test_entity
set clobfield = lo_from_bytea( 0, cast( clobfield as bytea ) ),
    firstlobfield = lo_from_bytea( 0, cast( firstlobfield as bytea ) ),
    secondlobfield = lo_from_bytea( 0, cast( secondlobfield as bytea ) )
----
