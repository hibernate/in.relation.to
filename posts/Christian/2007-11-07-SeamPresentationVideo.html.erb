<p class="wikiPara">
Two weeks ago I presented Seam at Grails eXchange in London. This presentation was recorded, unfortunately without the slides in the visible frame:

The <a href="/assets/IntroductionToJBossSeam-Sept07.pdf" target="" class="regularLink">attached slide deck</a> from September is almost the same as the one I used in the video. I guess the slides are actually more interesting than watching me walk around a table. Hm, I could find out how to cut a slide + audio version with the new iMovie...

I need to mention that I spent more time on JSF and EJB3 than usual because nobody in the room knew much about them (it was a Grails conference, after all). So if you just want to know something about Seam - and again, all quite basic - skip half an hour into the video.
