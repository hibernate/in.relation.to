<p class="wikiPara">
Had some time to package the Getting Started example code and put it on the
<a href="http://caveatemptor.hibernate.org" target="" class="regularLink">CaveatEmptor Website</a>. So all you MEAP
readers have something you can actually run without copy/pasting from the
PDFs. I should probably mention that the unedited draft you are reading with
MEAP is not completely in sync with the code I just packaged. Well, mostly the
Ant build files are a little different, so that shouldn't be a big problem.

Working on the CaveatEmptor main application package now, hopefully ready in a
week or two.
