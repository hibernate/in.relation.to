<p class="wikiPara">
Our book <q>Java Persistence with Hibernate</q> is now available in German. You can get it from <a href="http://www.hanser.de/buch.asp?isbn=978-3-446-40941-5" target="" class="regularLink">Hanser Verlag</a> and they also have an eBook edition available. This is a literal translation of the English original. However, to finish the translation faster we decided to cut the bonus chapter with the Seam introduction. Sorry folks, I will ask Manning if we can get this chapter published for free in the English original version. With Seam 2.0 approaching final release this is a bit outdated anyway.
