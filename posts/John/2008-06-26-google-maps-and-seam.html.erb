<p class="wikiPara">
Over on <a href="http://www.abstractec.co.uk/blog" target="" class="regularLink">Thinking in Seam</a>, I've been running a series on working with Google Maps using Seam and I thought it would be an idea to put the links to the series in order on here.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
First part of the process is to add a tag onto the map using the GMap tag from the RichFaces tag library. This processed is described on <a href="http://www.abstractec.co.uk/blog/index.php?itemid=30" target="" class="regularLink">Markers in Google Maps</a>.
</p>

Secondly, a little note on <a href="http://www.abstractec.co.uk/blog/index.php?itemid=31" target="" class="regularLink">UK postcodes with Google Maps</a> (in that, due to licensing issues, they do not work).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Next up is how to <a href="http://www.abstractec.co.uk/blog/index.php?itemid=38" target="" class="regularLink">populate your Google Map</a> - be warned, it's a big article! Also, there's <a href="http://www.abstractec.co.uk/blog/index.php?itemid=48" target="" class="regularLink">the follow-up article</a> in which a couple of issues I discovered after posting the original article are addressed.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Enjoy!</p>
