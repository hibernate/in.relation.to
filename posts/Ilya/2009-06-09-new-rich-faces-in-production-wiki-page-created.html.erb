<p class="wikiPara">
We are glad to announce a new <q><a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/RichFacesInProduction" target="" class="regularLink">RichFaces in Production</a></q> wiki page! The <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossrichfaces/" target="" class="regularLink">RichFaces</a> framework has a strong history and has been used by the <b>JSF</b> community for a long time. Until now we never provided a place for the community to showcase their projects and achievements that were completed with the help of <b>RichFaces</b>.  We think better late than never, so now the page is <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/RichFacesInProduction" target="" class="regularLink">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
If you are or have worked on a project that is using <b>RichFaces</b> or <b>Ajax4jsf</b> please see the wiki page for instructions and rules for posting, and it doesn't matter if you designed huge enterprise systems or small e-shop projects.  Any project story is interesting for all of us in the community!</p>
