It looks like we can add to the Christmas cheer by announcing that Seam 2.1.1 is now out.  Seam 2.1.1 is largely a bug-fix release, with a number of notable performance improvements, especially around hot deploy.  We've added support for PDF forms to the iText integration as well as <a href="http://in.relation.to/2008/12/09/open-id-and-seam" target="" class="regularLink">OpenID</a> support.  Seam-gen now generates IntelliJ IDEA projects.  And, I should also point out that we've changed a few of the URLs on examples to match up better with the example names.  If you are developing on Seam 2.1, you should consider upgrading quickly to get the latest fixes.
