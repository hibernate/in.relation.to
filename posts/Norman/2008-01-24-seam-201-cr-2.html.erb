The Seam team is back from the holidays, and we're quite happy to be able to say that the 2.0.1.CR2 Seam release is out.  We've only got a couple of minor housekeeping (docs) issues to address, so unless we see some big bugs in the next few days, I think we can expect to see a GA release early next week.
