We're happy to announce the release of
http://hibernate.org/ogm/releases/5.3/#get-it[Hibernate OGM 5.3.1.Final].

This is the first maintenance release of the 5.3 branch.

== What's new compared to 5.3.0.Final?

This is a maintenance release fixing issues related to native queries pagination and projection.

Pagination now works perfectly for MongoDB native queries that use aggregates.

You can see a complete list of the changes in the
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10160&version=31644[release notes].

This version is fully compatible with 5.3.0.Final.

== Components upgrade

 * Hibernate ORM 5.2.16.Final

== Projection and addEntity are not allowed in the same query

It is not possible anymore to execute a native query with projection
and extract the returned values as an entity list.

Given the entity:

====
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Movie {

	@Id
	private Integer id;
	private String name;
	private String author;
	private Integer year;

	public Movie() {
	}
}
----
====

If we try to get all movies using **projection** and **addEntity**:

====
[source,java]
----
session.createNativeQuery( "db.Movie.find( {}, { 'id' : 1, 'name' : 1  } )" )
	.addEntity( Movie.class )
	.uniqueResult();
----
====

An exception will be thrown and this message will be logged:

====
[source]
----
OGM000091: Projection and addEntity are not allowed in the same query on <Movie>
----
====

It is allowed either to use **projection** without **addEntity**:

====
[source,java]
----
session.createNativeQuery( "db.Movie.find( {}, { 'id' : 1, 'name' : 1  } )" )
	.uniqueResult();
----
====

Or to use **addEntity** without **projection**:

====
[source,java]
----
session.createNativeQuery( "db.Movie.find( {} )" )
	.addEntity( Movie.class )
	.uniqueResult();
----
====

This is true for all dialects supporting native queries, which at the moment of writing those lines are the MongoDB and Neo4j dialects.

This is consistent with the behavior of Hibernate ORM.

== Where can I get it?

You can include in your project the dialect of your choice using this Maven coordinates:

* http://infinispan.org[Infinispan]
** Embedded: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan-embedded:5.3.1.Final_
** Remote: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-infinispan-remote:5.3.1.Final_
* https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-mongodb:5.3.1.Final_
* http://neo4j.com[Neo4j]: _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-neo4j:5.3.1.Final_
