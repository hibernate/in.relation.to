Last night we released Hibernate ORM version `5.4.22.Final`.

This is a micro release: the result of backporting a number of fixes to our stable branch.

== A big thank you

Special thanks to Nathan Xu, Christian Beikov, Jan-Willem Gmelig Meyling, Yanming Zhou, Falko Modler, Moritz Becker and Dmitry Gusev, for all the amazing help in maintenance, giving some space to the core team to focus on the big picture.

It's great to see that not only did people step up to contribute patches, but also help by reviewing each other's patch.

This is a very welcome new trend, as it's difficult for us otherwise to provide proper feedback to all contributions, as we're getting a significant amount of excellent feedback, on a range of subjects!

Amazing.
