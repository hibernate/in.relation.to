<p class="wikiPara">
As every month, we're having a JBoss user group meeting in Newcastle. Next Tuesday 12th July at 6pm I'll be presenting
</p>

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-HibernateSearchAndOGMTakingAdvantageOfNoSQLLeavingOutTheComplexity"><a href="/2011/07/07/newcastlejbug-meeting-about-hibernate-search-hibernate-ogm#H-HibernateSearchAndOGMTakingAdvantageOfNoSQLLeavingOutTheComplexity">Hibernate Search and OGM: taking advantage of NoSQL leaving out the complexity</a></h2>
<p class="wikiPara">
and as always I'm looking forward to talk to all attendees: we'll follow up with free drinks and food to discuss about anything: open questions, suggestions, opportunities to tell your use cases in person, meet other developers.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Discussing code changes is also an option, so don't miss this opportunity to make sure your favourite tools are better fit for your needs!
</p>
