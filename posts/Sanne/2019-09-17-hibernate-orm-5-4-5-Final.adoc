== An exciting micro update !?

Version `5.4.5.Final` might look like "just another micro update" but it's packed with great improvements.

The reason we only bump the "micro" version is because we managed to maintain strict backward compatibility in this iteration,
even though the number of improvements was unusually high.

So what's so great of this release?

 - tested with http://jdk.java.net/13/[OpenJDK 13]
 - several strong performance improvements
 - usual round of bugfixes

=== Java 13 compatibility

Java 13 is here today, and all our integration tests pass.

Of course JDK8 compatibility is still available, and JDK11 compatibility as well.

N.B. we no longer test on JDK9 and JDK10, and we will probably be stopping to run tests on JDK12 soon as well.

=== Great performance improvements for the simple cases

It used to be the case that opening a new `Session` (or a new `EntityManager`) was a relatively not-so-cheap operation, as Hibernate needs creating several internal Maps to represent its context.

We never considered this a priority to optimise for: we'd recommend to reuse them, and expect most people would use Hibernate for non trivial operations, offsetting the allocation overhead.

Another reason to not focus on such optimisations for corner cases was that to achieve peak performance for more complex cases, in particular real world workloads, focusing on the simple case would have been a limitation for the real case - it turns out this assumption was unfounded, as we now figured that a lot could be done without a negative impact on the general purpose scenario.

Several fixes in this version address the memory allocation aspect of opening such a new `Session`/`EntityManager`, and dodge some computational overhead as well; I won't be sharing the exact figures as so much will depend on your specific configuration and needs, but I wouldn't be surprised if people would report benefiting an 400% throughput improvement on simple one-shot operations: I have "lab evidence" that this is possible, and even beyond, but since much of such metrics are only possible in specifically crafted microbenchmarks one must concede that real world applications will not highlight the same level of improvements.

If you happen to be interested in performance and could try it out, please share your findings! At very least it motivates us to keep aiming for more :-)

In fact, Hibernate ORM at this point is not that much heavier than using JDBC directly - there's still some work to do to achieve parity but I'm surprised to find myself thinking that it's actually not unrealistic to aim for full parity with plain JDBC in the near future. Considering also that the ORM has a better overall overview on the execution plan, this can help unlocking more optimisations than an imperative approach when combined with technologies such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus]. My over-optimistic guess is that we might even beat plain JDBC in some specific contexts.

Exciting times!

== What's next

We're still working hard on Hibernate ORM 6. This version will of course include the optimisations mentioned above, but will also have significant improvements on the quality and adaptability of the generated SQL.

We will of course also keep maintaining `5.4.x` for quite some time: as usual expect more bugfixes and more improvements at the next round.

Little spoiler: the team is finally able to carve some spare time to explore Reactive database access; we're investigating the possibilities of a next-gen data access layer, with some guidance from the experts from the https://vertx.io/[Eclipse VertX] team and those from Pivotal working on https://r2dbc.io/[R2DBC] - but still have a lot to learn.

Timelines and adoption across database vendors are quite unclear yet though, so I won't say more for the time being. Stay tuned!
