<p class="wikiPara">
Just after the release of <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateORM428FinalReleased" target="" class="regularLink">Hibernate ORM 4.2.8.Final</a> last week, we realized one of the many performance improvements had broken integration with latest stable release of Hibernate Search 4.4.0.Final.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Rather than rolling back some of these nice improvements in Hibernate ORM we decided it was more appropriate to get a fixed version of Hibernate Search out, so here you have Hibernate Search 4.4.1.Final.
</p>

<h1 class="wikiHeadline1" id="H-WhatsDifferentComparedTo440Final"><a href="/2013/12/09/hibernate-search-441-final-released-fixing-compatibility-with-hibernate-orm-428#H-WhatsDifferentComparedTo440Final">What's different compared to 4.4.0.Final ?</a></h1>
<p class="wikiPara">
Since this is our stable branch, it contains exclusively the compatibility fix. All other patches developed in the meantime will stay in the 4.5 and master branches only.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Thanks once again to Guillaume Smet for reporting and fixing the issue!

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-DownloadLinks"><a href="/2013/12/09/hibernate-search-441-final-released-fixing-compatibility-with-hibernate-orm-428#H-DownloadLinks">Download links</a></h2>
<p class="wikiPara">
As usual, you can download the distribution from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/4.4.1.Final/" target="" class="regularLink">Sourceforge</a>, or if you use Maven you will find it mirrored in Maven Central very soon.
