<img src="https://docs.jboss.org/author/download/attachments/3737207/ISPN" align="left" hspace="8px">Two weeks ago we where at Devoxx, with Pete Muir and Mircea Markus we had a three hours long workshop about using <i class="wikiEmphasis">Infinispan</i> in a real world JEE application. All our notes for the presentation <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Lab+-+Getting+Started+with+Infinispan" target="" class="regularLink">are available here</a>, and it includes the source code used for the demo and all slides. <br>The instructions contain both a zip of the source code or pointers to a Git repository; if you're familiar with Git the history contains each step from the guide so you can try follow the workshop chapter by chapter: we hope it's clear enough for anyone not familiar with Infinispan, if not questions and suggestions for improvements are welcome.</div>

<h1 class="wikiHeadline1" id="H-HibernateOGMAndSearchUpdates"><a href="/2011/12/06/after-devoxxjbug-newcastle#H-HibernateOGMAndSearchUpdates">Hibernate OGM and Search updates</a></h1>
<p class="wikiPara">
At the same conference as a member of the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/ogm.html" target="" class="regularLink">Hibernate OGM</a> team we met Greg Luck from EHCache fame and we started some concrete plans to support <a href="http://ehcache.org" target="" class="regularLink">EHCache</a> as a data store for Hibernate OGM. If anyone wants to write a custom module for OGM, please note that we have now an experimental integration layer and Infinispan is no longer a dependency: we have instead an example implementation using a HashMap, so it should be easy to integrate with any other NoSQL database. Some interest was shown around Neo4J, MongoDB and HBase integration, but we need a volunteer to start working on it... feel free to join!

<p class="wikiPara">
In a different area, same conference we met Karel Maesen of Hibernate Spatial, so stay tuned for a better integration in that area; if you're interested in geolocation you might want to have a look at the draft for integration in Hibernate Search being proposed by Emmanuel and Nicholas Helleringer at <a href="https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HSEARCH-923" target="" class="regularLink">HSEARCH-923</a>.

<p class="wikiPara">
Next week I'll be in the Newcastle office introducing Arquillian and Shrinkwrap together with Paul Robinson, the lead of the Web Service Transactions project. The talk is named <u>Testing JEE Applications in the container using Arquillian</u>: after an introduction on the coolest testing tools we plan to run a workshop and have everyone try it out.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The workshop is scheduled for <i class="wikiEmphasis">Tuesday 13th December</i> in the University of Newcastle, and as always discussions and questions are welcome on any JBoss technology. Full details of the event can be found <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/DecemberJBUGMeeting" target="" class="regularLink">here</a>.</p>
