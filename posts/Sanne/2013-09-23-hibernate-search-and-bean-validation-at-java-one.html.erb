Emmanuel is headed to JavaOne, where you can see his hands-on presentations: live on stage coding showing the latest features of <i class="wikiEmphasis">Hibernate Search</i> and <i class="wikiEmphasis">Bean Validation</i>.
It's a unique experience to see how easy it is to get started with these technologies, and also what powerful features they can provide you in just one hour coding.

<blockquote class="wikiBlockquote">
Search is passé; we need Foursquare-style location and should let people search in specific vicinities. And no, you don’t have to leave Java or JavaEE to make this a breeze. This session shows you how to boost your existing applications by easily adding full-text search, spatial search, faceting, and even all at the same time! Faceted results return the list of results as well as their count by category—price range, brand, colour, and so on. This session takes an existing JavaEE7–based application and adds search services via Hibernate Search. It favours code and step-by-step IDE work over slides.

Java EE 7 is a very rich environment. This session takes you on a practical code-driven Bean Validation walk-through: how to use it in your applications and what not to do—all with an example-driven approach. The presentation gradually adds constraints and validations to an existing application and examines many features, both old and new, including constraint declaration, custom constraint, method validation, EL-based message interpolation, JAX-RS integration, and many more. It spends as much time as possible in the IDE. No previous knowledge of Bean Validation is required.
