<p class="wikiPara">
Tonight we released Hibernate Search version <i class="wikiEmphasis">5.3.0.CR1</i> (candidate release).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We consider this stable, and besides some pending documentation improvements, we'll re-publish the same implementation as 5.3.0.Final in ten days. Last chance to provide feedback! Please try it out.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
The technology which Hibernate Search uses under the hood to implement this amazing feature has been improved and polished in various years by the Apache Lucene team. So far Hibernate Search has been using an <q>old and proven</q> technique but this had several limitations.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We believe the new implementation is now mature enough for our users too, and probably should have switched earlier if we didn't have other subjects to attack.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
From a user's perspective, there are less limitations and the API is the same, <i class="wikiEmphasis">with one migration catch</i>: please remember you now need to opt-in the fields you want to use for faceting explicitly! For that, use the <tt>@Facet</tt> annotation as shown in <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateSearch530Beta1WithNativeLuceneFaceting" target="" class="regularLink">the example of the previous post</a> and in the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.3/reference/en-US/html_single/#query-faceting" target="" class="regularLink">Faceting reference documentation</a>.

<h2 class="wikiHeadline2" id="H-WhatsNext"><a href="/2015/06/02/the-new-faceting-engine-gets-closer-hibernate-search-530-cr-1-released#H-WhatsNext">What's next?</a></h2>

<p class="wikiPara">
Our immediate focus is to release am experimental tag to support Hibernate ORM 5: remember, Hibernate Search versions from 4.5 up to (and including) 5.3 are only compatible with Hibernate ORM versions 4.3.x.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Of course, we're also looking forward for feedback and will try and schedule any issues you encounter on the latest versions to be fixed ASAP. Suggestions and contributions are welcome as well!
