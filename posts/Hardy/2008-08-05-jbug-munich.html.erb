Just waiting for my flight back to Sweden after being invited to present Hibernate Search at the monthly JBUG Munich meeting. I was pleasantly suprised that despite school holidays a respectable crowd showed up for the meeting. The feedback was throughout positiv and hopefully there are now a few new Search convertees spreading the word in Munich.

One question which popped up was whether the performance of Hibernate Search is somehow quantifiable. Of course the same applies here for Hibernate Search as for Core (see <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/15.html" target="" class="regularLink"> http://www.hibernate.org/15.html</a>) - each application is different and it is hard to find a fair and compareable benchmark. I wonder though whether some specific benchmarks similar to the ones posted on the Lucene homepage would make sense.

Last but not least - the highlight of the evening - German wheat beer after the presentation. That alone was worth the trip ;-)
