<p class="wikiPara">
Moving along towards a 5.2 Final, we are happy to announce
the release of Hibernate Validator 5.2.0.CR1. The main goal of this release was to fix
bugs and polish some of the new features. For example, we reviewed the
<tt>Optional</tt> validation support and made sure its behavior is (what we think)
consistent in all cases. You can find the full change log on
<a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10060&amp;version=19254" target="" class="regularLink">JIRA</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Despite the focus on bug fixes, we still managed to sneak in a couple of new features.
Hibernate Validator offers now a <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-time-provider" target="" class="regularLink">TimeProvider</a> contract, as well
as an <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-extensions-path-api" target="" class="regularLink">extension</a> of the
<a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/beanvalidation/spec/1.1/api/javax/validation/Path.html" target="" class="regularLink">Path API</a> which allows to obtain the value of the represented property. Refer to the online documentation for more information.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Another more general question, which created quite a bit of discussion, revolved around
the validation of Java 8 date/time types (JSR 310) (see
<a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-874" target="" class="regularLink">HV-874</a>). The question is, whether
we can/should provide default <tt>ConstraintValidator</tt> implementations for
<tt>@Past</tt> and <tt>@Future</tt> validating <tt>LocalDate</tt> (or any of the other date/time types which
do not represent a instant in time). The Javadocs tells us:
</p>

<blockquote class="wikiBlockquote">
This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone. Instead, it is a description
of the date, as used for birthdays. It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without
additional information such as an offset or time-zone.
</blockquote>

<p class="wikiPara">
Without a instant in time, however, past and future are undefined. One can only validate
such an instant by associating a timezone with it. But which one? The time zone of the
current JVM? That could lead to unexpected behavior for example in client-server
applications. If you have an opinion on this or an idea on how to solve this, please leave a
comment or use any of the other means listed below to get into touch with us. 
We would love to hear from you.
For now, Hibernate Validator will not support <tt>LocalDate</tt> out of the box. We will see how
this pans out.
