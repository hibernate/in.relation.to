<a href="https://github.com/gsmet" target="" class="regularLink">Guillaume</a> pointed out recently on the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/community/mailinglists" target="" class="regularLink">hibernate-dev mailing list</a> that is has been a very long time since the last release of Hibernate JPA Metamodel Generator release and that it is time to do another one. And we listened. We just released 1.3.0.Final. As usual, you can get the artefacts from the <a href="https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public/org/hibernate/hibernate-jpamodelgen/1.3.0.Final" target="" class="regularLink">JBoss Maven repo</a> or from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-jpamodelgen/1.3.0.Final" target="" class="regularLink">SourceForge</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Don't say that we are not listening to our users and contributors. There might have been, however, some self interest in Guillaume's request. After all he reported three of the <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10110&amp;version=11208" target="" class="regularLink">10</a> resolved issues and even contributed patches to fix them. Thanks for your help! To single out one of the 10 issues, it should be <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/METAGEN-92" target="" class="regularLink">METAGEN-92</a>. Its fix will make sure that the annotation processor will now also work with JPA 2.1 configuration files (<tt>persistence.xml</tt> and <tt>orm.xml</tt>).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
In case you forgot how to setup the annotation processor in Maven have a look at this <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateMetamodelGenerator110Final" target="" class="regularLink">post</a> and don't forget to report any issues in the Hibernate JIRA project <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/METAGEN" target="" class="regularLink">METAGEN</a>.

Enjoy!</p>
